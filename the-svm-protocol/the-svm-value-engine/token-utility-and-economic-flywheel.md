# Token Utility & Economic Flywheel

Sport Value Market isn’t a one-off token drop.\
It’s a **repeatable, scalable flywheel** that turns every user action into protocol momentum — and every token into a lever of growth.

This is how we go from a few airdrops…\
→ to a memecoin ecosystem for every athlete\
→ to a fan-owned economic layer for global sport.

Let’s break it down.

### 🔗 The Utility Stack

SVM is powered by **three interconnected assets**, each with specific, reinforcing roles:

***

#### 1️⃣ **SPTs (Sport Player Tokens)**

The first memecoins that actually do something.

* **Stake** to earn weekly performance-based rewards
* **Trade** on DEXs based on hype, virality, or career momentum
* **Access** airdrops, prediction markets, leaderboards, and more
* **Govern** your favorite player’s launch or delisting via DAO votes (coming soon)

> Each SPT is its own mini-economy — and the more athletes, the more economies we launch.

***

#### 2️⃣ **Sporties (Ecosystem Points)**

The cross-protocol glue — earned through both **social and on-chain activity**.

* Used to **enter airdrop campaigns**
* Influence token distribution
* Create long-term alignment between fans and the ecosystem

> The more you do, the more you earn. And the more you earn, the more you can claim.

***

#### 3️⃣ **SVT (Sport Value Token)**

The protocol’s governance and utility token. _(Launching later.)_

* Will be used to **vote**, **govern**, and **earn protocol revenue**
* Can unlock premium features, airdrop boosts, and exclusive roles
* Will become the **value layer** that ties the whole system together

> For now, everything flows into Sporties and SPTs. SVT arrives when the ecosystem’s ready.

### 🔁 The Flywheel in Motion

Here’s how it compounds:

1. 🔄 Users engage → Earn Sporties → Join airdrops
2. 🧲 New SPTs launch → Trading/staking begins
3. 📈 Protocol earns fees → Rewards and treasury grow
4. 🪙 Rewards go to stakers and the DAO
5. 🎯 SVT (later) will govern, allocate, and distribute value
6. 🌐 More players launch → More campaigns → More loops restart

> Every new athlete = new market\
> Every new market = more users\
> More users = more value generated\
> More value = stronger DAO and future protocol apps

### 💡 Designed for Replayability

Most crypto projects are linear: one hype cycle, one launch, then decay.\
SVM is **circular** — and infinite:

* Every new token restarts the flywheel
* Every week brings new campaigns
* Every sport expands the opportunity set
* The protocol doesn’t just grow — it **accelerates**

We’ve built the rails for a **fan-owned financial layer** — and this is the engine that powers it.

***

### 🏁 TL;DR

The SVM Flywheel:

* 🔁 Stake → Earn → Trade → Govern
* 🪙 Use Sporties → Claim airdrops → Fuel token launches
* 📈 Grow the protocol → Strengthen the DAO → Launch more

It’s memecoins + fandom + yield + governance.\
It’s DeFi made fun — and sports made financial.

And it only gets stronger with each new player added to the game.
