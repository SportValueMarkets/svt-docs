# ⭕ The Value Loop

At the heart of Sport Value Market is a powerful, replayable loop:\
**You engage. You stake. You earn. You grow.**

This is more than a reward system. It’s the flywheel that powers the entire fan-owned economy — combining social participation, token staking, and airdrop allocation into one unstoppable flow.

***

### 🧩 Dual Reward Engine

SVM is built on **two primary earning tracks**:

#### 1. 🏅 Staking Rewards from Sport Star Performance

Stake your SPTs and earn **weekly yield** based on how your athlete performs in real life.

* It’s not gambling — you never lose your tokens
* Performance boosts = higher rewards
* Underperformance = lower yield, not loss
* Rewards come from protocol revenue and ecosystem flows

This is the beating heart of SVM: **no-loss fan staking** based on insight, not luck.

***

#### 2. 🪙 Sporties for Ecosystem Participation

Earn Sporties by being active — both on-chain and socially.

* Buy & stake SPTs
* Provide liquidity
* Refer others
* Complete social quests (via Zealy, TaskOn, etc.)

Sporties are your **unified reward points** — used to enter airdrop campaigns and showcase your contributions.

***

### 🔁 The Full Loop

Let’s break it down step-by-step:

***

#### 1️⃣ Earn

* 📈 Stake SPTs for performance rewards
* 🧩 Complete tasks and quests to earn Sporties
* 🧲 Refer friends for bonus rewards
* 🔄 Trade and interact on-chain

Every action you take earns something — whether tokens or points.

***

#### 2️⃣ Allocate

* 🎟 Use your **Sporties** to enter airdrop campaigns
* 💪 Choose the Sport Star you believe in
* 🎯 Strategy matters — allocate across many or go all-in on one

You decide how to play. Bigger commitments mean bigger potential upside.

***

#### 3️⃣ Claim

Once an airdrop campaign ends:

* 🥇 80% is distributed **proportionally** to points allocated
* 🛡 20% is split equally using **Base Airdrop Guarantee (BAG)** for all eligible participants

Separately:

* 🏅 Your staked SPTs pay out **weekly** based on athlete performance

> You don’t just get airdrops. You get **ongoing, no-loss rewards** too.

***

### 🔁 Why It Works

This loop builds a **positive-sum ecosystem**:

* Fans stake → Rewards flow → Tokens circulate
* Users engage → Points rise → Airdrops amplify
* Protocol earns fees → Treasury grows → Value recycles
* Community grows → More $SPTs launch → More loops restart

Every new performance token adds **fresh fuel** to the value engine.

***

### 🏁 TL;DR

**The SVM Value Loop = Dual Reward Flywheel**

* ✅ Stake $SPTs → earn passive weekly rewards
* ✅ Engage + refer → earn Sporties
* ✅ Allocate Sporties → claim massive airdrops
* 🔄 Reinvest, stake again, earn more

> It’s not just one-and-done. It’s an **infinite game**.
