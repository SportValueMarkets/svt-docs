# Treasury Use

The SVM Treasury is the war chest of the protocol — a community-governed vault of funds designed to **accelerate growth**, **reward participation**, and **fuel long-term sustainability**.

It’s not controlled by a company. It’s controlled by you — the fans, the token holders, the DAO.

***

### 🏦 What Funds the Treasury?

Once live, the treasury will be filled by protocol-generated revenue:

* 💸 **SPT Launch Fees** – small fee on new athlete token launches
* 🔁 **Trading Fees** – % from buys, sells, or liquidity events
* 📊 **Staking Fees** – a portion of staking yield or vault rewards
* 🛠 **Future dApps** – revenue-sharing from prediction markets, fantasy apps, etc.
* 🪂 **Unclaimed Airdrop Allocations** – recycled back into the treasury over time

> Every interaction with SVM feeds back into a flywheel — part of that fuel flows to the DAO.

### 🎯 How Treasury Funds Can Be Used

The treasury isn’t just storage — it’s ammunition. Here’s what it can fund:

### 🧭 Treasury Management

Initially, the treasury will be overseen by a **multi-sig wallet** with signers from the SVM core team and trusted community members.

Once the DAO matures:

* 🗳 Community proposals will decide treasury outflows
* 👥 Elected stewards or committees may be introduced
* 🔐 All transactions will be transparent and trackable on-chain

> No backroom deals. No opaque spending. Just fan-powered financial strategy.

***

### 🏁 TL;DR

* Treasury is funded by protocol activity: launches, trading, staking, more
* DAO decides how it’s used: campaigns, grants, product, dApps, growth
* Controlled transparently and democratically by $SVM holders
* Treasury = your lever to expand, reward, and evolve the SVM ecosystem

> It’s not just a fund — it’s your **toolkit to build a sportfi world**. 🛠️🏆
