# Roles of $SVM Holders

$SVM isn’t just a governance token. It’s your on-chain ticket to **protocol-level ownership** — giving you direct power over how SVM grows, evolves, and rewards its community.

Whether you’re here to vote, propose, or shape new campaigns, **holding $SVM puts you in the driver’s seat** of the sportfi revolution.

### 🏛️ What You Can Do as an $SVM Holder

Once launched, $SVM holders will be able to:

| Role Type                 | What It Means                                                                             |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🗳 **Voter**              | Participate in on-chain proposals that shape protocol upgrades, rewards, and priorities   |
| 💬 **Proposer**           | Submit new proposals for the community to vote on (after meeting minimum criteria)        |
| 🔁 **Strategic Delegate** | Let others vote with your $SVM (delegate your power to active contributors)               |
| 🧠 **Contributor**        | Help guide SVM governance discussions, coordinate campaigns, or support proposal drafting |

> You don’t need to be technical. You just need vision — and a little $SVM in your wallet.

### ❌ What $SVM _Doesn't_ Grant (Yet)

* **Direct access to funds:** Treasury outflows will be managed by smart contracts or through trusted multi-sigs
* **Team positions or Ultra Fan roles:** Those are separate from $SVM holdings (though active holders are encouraged to participate)
* **All-powerful governance:** SVM is being built with checks, balances, and phased decentralization — voting will evolve over time

### 🚧 What’s Coming with Governance

$SVM is not live yet — and we’re not rushing it. It will launch when the ecosystem is active, performance tokens are live, and fans are ready to govern.

That means:

* On-chain voting will roll out progressively
* We'l ltry to have delegation and quorum systems built in from the start
* More complex features (e.g. proposal thresholds, voting types) will be introduced as we scale

> First we prove product-market fit. Then we hand over the keys — piece by piece — to the fans.

### 🏁 TL;DR

* $SVM = governance and protocol ownership
* Hold it to vote, propose, delegate, and help shape the direction of SVM
* It doesn’t grant treasury control directly — but it _does_ give you power over how the protocol allocates its resources
* $SVM holders are the backbone of the fan-owned sportfi future

**You don’t just watch the game — you shape the field it’s played on.** 🏟️
