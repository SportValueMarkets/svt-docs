# Voting Power

In the Sport Value Market (SVM) ecosystem, real ownership means real influence.

And when $SVT (Sport Value Token) goes live, **voting power** becomes the core way holders shape the protocol’s future — from token launches to treasury allocation to new sport integrations.

***

### 🧠 How Voting Power Will Work

Voting power will be based on the amount of **SVT you hold and stake**, with possible future upgrades like locking periods, delegation, or reputation weighting.

> The more SVT you commit, the greater your impact on decisions that matter.

Key variables to define (via DAO proposals):

* 🕐 **Staking or locking model** — long-term holders may get more voting weight
* 👥 **Delegation support** — for passive holders who want to assign their votes
* 🧮 **Reputation or quadratic voting** — future options to ensure fairness

### 📦 What You’ll Vote On

Once the DAO is active, voting power will be used to influence key decisions like:

| Category                  | Example Proposals                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Token Launches**        | Approve new athlete token listings (SPTs)                           |
| **Staking Rules**         | Adjust reward emissions, eligibility, or vault terms                |
| **Fee % and Allocations** | Change how protocol revenue is made and is split or burned          |
| **Treasury Spending**     | Fund campaigns, partnerships, grants, or development                |
| **Protocol Upgrades**     | Roll out new mechanics, support new chains or leagues               |
| **Ultra Fans Program**    | Approve new Captains, Ultra Fan tiers, rewards, or any other aspect |

> Every vote pushes the ecosystem forward — or keeps it aligned with its values.

### 🧬 Decentralization by Design

The governance model will evolve in **stages**:

1. **Launch Phase**\
   Core team controls emergency upgrades\
   Community feedback shapes early meta
2. **SVT Activation**\
   Voting portal goes live\
   Initial proposals seeded by early supporters and ambassadors
3. **Mature DAO**\
   Treasury, parameters, and expansion fully governed on-chain\
   Contributors organize around proposals, tooling, and verticals

***

### 💡 TL;DR

* SVT gives you voting power — the more you stake, the more say you have
* Proposals will cover everything from rewards to roadmaps
* DAO voting keeps SVM aligned with its users, not a central company
* Governance begins soon after SVT launch

> It’s not just token voting. It’s _fan-powered protocol control._
