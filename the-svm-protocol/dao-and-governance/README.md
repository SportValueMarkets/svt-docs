# 🤝 DAO & Governance

**SVM isn’t just a protocol — it’s a public utility for sports fandom.**\
And it will be governed like one: **by the fans, for the fans**, using $SVT.

The DAO will be the beating heart of Sport Value Market, ensuring that no single company, admin, or VC can dictate its future.

***

### 🗳 What the DAO Will Govern

Once SVT is live and the DAO is activated, community members will begin voting on major protocol decisions:

* ✅ Launching new SPTs (Athlete Tokens)
* ✅ Adjusting staking, airdrop, or fee mechanics
* ✅ Allocating treasury funds: growth, grants, campaigns
* ✅ Choosing new leagues, regions, and sports to onboard
* ✅ Managing the Ultra Fans Program and other community incentives
* ✅ Upgrading smart contracts, features, or reward structures

> If it matters to the ecosystem, the DAO should control it.

### 🔧 The Role of SVT (Coming Soon)

**SVT** is the upcoming governance token of SVM. It’s not live yet — we’re rolling it out only after the protocol, airdrops, and staking economy have matured.

Once launched, SVT will be used to:

* Vote on proposals
* Direct treasury spending
* Influence key launches and upgrades
* Share in protocol revenue
* Unlock deeper features or access tiers

> The SVT launch won’t just mark governance — it will mark ownership.

***

### 🏦 Treasury Control

The DAO will also control the SVM treasury — funded by:

* Token launches (SPTs)
* Trading fees
* Staking and protocol revenue
* Airdrop fees or LP mechanics (future)

DAO proposals will determine how to use this capital to accelerate adoption, fund builders, and support protocol sustainability.

### 🧠 Community-Led by Design

SVM’s decentralization is built to evolve in phases:

1. **Now:** Core team launches core mechanics and economy
2. **Short-Term:** Community earns Sporties, joins campaigns, and shapes meta
3. **Later:** DAO launches with full treasury + governance rights
4. **Long-Term:** Contributors, devs, fans, and athletes govern everything

There’s no “team wallet forever.”\
No secret committee pulling strings.\
Just real ownership, from real fans, building a new era of sport.

### 🏁 TL;DR

* 🪙 SVT = Governance token (launching later)
* 🗳 DAO will control token launches, fees, upgrades, and expansion
* 🧠 Treasury decisions = community-led
* ⚖️ Full decentralization is the endgame — and we’re building toward it fast

> In the future, every athlete can be tokenized.\
> And every fan can help decide how it happens.
