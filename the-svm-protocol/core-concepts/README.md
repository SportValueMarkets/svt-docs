# 👾 Core Concepts

SVM is built on simple, powerful ideas that turn athletes into assets — and fans into stakeholders.

We’ve taken the best of fantasy sports, DeFi, and meme culture, and merged them into a protocol where every moment, every player, and every fan becomes part of the game.

These are the core building blocks:

***

### 🏅 SPTs (Athlete Tokens)

Every athlete gets a fixed-supply, performance-linked ERC-20 token.\
Fans can buy, sell, or stake these tokens to earn from player performance — no betting required.

> It's like owning a piece of your favorite player — and getting paid when they perform.

***

### 🪙 SVT (Governance Token)

SVT is the token that powers community ownership and coordination.\
Use it to vote, propose new launches, manage the treasury, and shape the protocol’s evolution.

> Stakeholders run the protocol — not companies, not platforms.

***

### 🧮 Sporties (Unified Points)

Earn Sporties by using the protocol: staking, trading, completing quests, and referrals.\
Then allocate them toward Player Token airdrops through a transparent, on-chain system.

> One point system. Every airdrop. Real rewards for real activity.

***

### 🔁 No-Loss Performance Staking

SVM is not betting — it's staking with no downside.\
Stake a player's token, earn weekly rewards based on their real-world performance.\
Even if they underperform? You keep your tokens.

***

### 🪂 Repeatable Airdrops

Every athlete launch brings a new airdrop campaign.\
The more you participate, the more you can earn — and the more the ecosystem grows.

* 80% of airdrops are distributed proportionally to points spent
* 20% go to anyone who meets the minimum threshold — **BAG-style fairness**

***

### 🛠 A Protocol, Not Just a Product

SVM is open-source, composable, and designed for infinite replayability:

* Builders can create games, leaderboards, dashboards, or meme prediction markets
* Fans can launch hype campaigns or support underdogs
* DAO members direct the future of the protocol

> It’s not just a site. It’s the sportfi internet.
