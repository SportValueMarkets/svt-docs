# 📩 $SVMs: Governance Token

$**SVM (Sport Value Market's Token)** is the upcoming governance and utility token of the SVM protocol.\
While it's not live yet, it’s designed to be the **core coordination layer** for the entire ecosystem once we reach critical traction.

> Right now, we're building the market.\
> Soon, you'll help own and steer it.

### 🧠 What Is $SVM?

$SVM will serve as:

* 🏛 **The governance token** for DAO proposals, votes, and upgrades
* 💰 **A claim on protocol value** — via revenue sharing, buybacks, and treasury use
* 🔑 **A permission layer** — for launching new athlete tokens and expanding utilities
* 🧱 **A meta asset** — backing the growth of SVM itself, not just individual Sport Stars

> If $SPTs are how you back Sport Stars, $SVM is how you bet on the whole ecosystem.

### 📅 Why It’s Not Live Yet

SVM is starting with:

* 🧬 Athlete token launches ($SPTs)
* 🪂 Airdrop campaigns via Sporties
* 📈 Community growth and performance data

$SVM will launch **later**, once:

* $SPT markets show traction
* Sporties ecosystem is active
* The protocol requires governance and coordination

This ensures:

* No empty governance
* No premature dilution
* Maximum fairness for early contributors and real fans

***

### 🔮 What $SVM Will Power

Once launched, $SVM will unlock:

* 🗳 **Voting** on protocol upgrades, launches, and parameter changes
* 📦 **Treasury allocation** for buybacks, LPs, grants, or ecosystem support
* 🛠 **Protocol-level decisions**: fee changes, sport integrations, expansion
* 🚀 **Special access** to future features, tools, or campaigns

It’s not just a token — it’s your voice in the sportfi economy we’re building.

***

### 🧩 Utility-Driven Design

$SVM will be designed for:

* 🔁 **Staking / locking** mechanisms for yield and power boosts
* 📉 **Fee discounts** on future SVM features
* 🪂 **Airdrop benefits** for holders in platform-wide events
* 🧠 **Potential slashing / security roles** in later protocol modules
* 🎮 **Token-gated experiences** for power users or creators

***

### 📊 Tokenomics Snapshot (Coming Soon)

Details will be shared before launch — but expect:

* A fixed cap
* DAO-controlled treasury
* Community-heavy allocation
* Long-term emissions aligned with actual protocol growth

> No pre-launch dumpers. No fake scarcity.\
> Just a fair rollout for real participants.

***

### 🏁 TL;DR

* $SVM is **not live yet** — it comes once the ecosystem is ready
* It will be the **DAO key** to SVM: governing athlete launches, fees, and rewards
* Designed for **utility, staking, and coordination**
* Meant for **long-term holders, not flippers**

> When $SVM goes live, it won’t just be another token —\
> it’ll be **the fuel that powers the sportfi revolution** from the inside out.
