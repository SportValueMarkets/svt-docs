# 🏆 Sporties: Point System

**Sporties** are the fuel of the SVM ecosystem — your on-chain proof of activity, engagement, and loyalty.

They’re not just points. They’re power.

> Earn them by doing what you already love.\
> Spend them to unlock airdrops across the athlete universe.\
> Stack them to become a force in the sportfi economy.

***

### 🧠 What Are Sporties?

**Sporties** are non-transferable, on-chain points that **don’t cost money** — you earn them by participating, and they’re your ticket into the most valuable rewards in SVM: airdrops.

They are:

* 🪪 **Proof of your loyalty** and protocol activity
* 🎟️ **Your key to airdrop campaigns** across all $SPTs
* 🧱 **A foundational layer** in the ecosystem’s social + financial loop

> The more Sporties you earn, the more you can claim.\
> The earlier you participate, the bigger your edge.

### 🪂 How Airdrops Work

Sporties aren’t the airdrop — they’re how you get access.

Each airdrop campaign works like this:

#### 1. **You allocate Sporties** to an SPT airdrop pool

You decide when and where to use your points.

#### 2. **The drop is split in two:**

* 🥇 **80% Proportional Allocation**
  * Based on how many Sporties you spent relative to the pool
* 🛡 **20% Base Airdrop Guarantee (BAG)**
  * Equal share to everyone who crosses the minimum point threshold

> High spenders get more.\
> But meaningful contributors never walk away empty-handed.

### 🎮 Early System: XP → Sporties

Before we launch the full on-chain reward engine, we’re starting with:

* 🧩 Zealy
* 🧩 TaskOn

You’ll earn XP by completing quests — which will later be **converted into Sporties** once the reward system goes live.

> Get in early, bank your XP, and be first in line for the biggest drops.

***

### 🔄 The Value Loop

Sporties create a compounding flywheel:

1. 📈 You engage
2. 🎯 You earn Sporties
3. 🪂 You spend them on SPT airdrops
4. 📊 You start staking, trading, referring
5. 🔁 You earn even more

It’s not a one-time grind. It’s a **forever economy** that scales with every new player, campaign, and drop.

### 🔭 What’s Coming Next

Sporties will soon unlock more layers of participation:

* 🔼 Leaderboards and bragging rights
* 🎖️ Badges, OG roles, and streak achievements
* 🧬 Tier-based recognition and reward tiers
* 🧲 Community voting or DAO access for high scorers

> Your Sporties aren’t just points — they’re your identity in the sportfi world.

***

### 🏁 TL;DR

* Earned through on-chain actions + social tasks
* Spent to access airdrop campaigns
* Rewards the most engaged and loyal users
* Early XP converts into Sporties later
* It’s the core loop of the sportfi economy

**You don’t pay to play. You play to earn.**\
And this is just the beginning.
