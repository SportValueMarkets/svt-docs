# 💱 Protocol Revenue

SVM is not just a protocol — it’s a self-sustaining, revenue-generating ecosystem. This page breaks down how value flows through the system, where protocol revenue comes from, and how it’s redistributed to stakeholders.

***

### 💸 Protocol Revenue

The protocol earns fees through several core mechanisms:

#### 🧮 1. Bonding Curve Sales

* A **1.5% fee** is applied to each buy and sell of $SPTs on the bonding curve.
* The bonding curve ensures early access and price discovery for each athlete.
* Revenue from bonding curve sales is also used to fund liquidity on DEXs once an $SPT exits the curve.

#### 🔁 2. Post-Curve Trading (DEX)

* After bonding curve caps are reached, $SPTs trade on external or SVM-integrated DEXs.
* A **0.3% fee** is charged per trade (0.2% for LPs, 0.1% for protocol and reward pools).

#### 🧱 3. Additional dApps & Use Cases

* The protocol will launch additional dApps (e.g. an **NFT marketplace**, advanced staking layers, and more) that generate fees.
* These fees will **further support the $SPT reward pools**, reinforcing the ecosystem's sustainability.
* Each dApp is designed to add utility and value across the $SPT and $SVM ecosystem.

#### 🪂 4. Staking & Unstaking Fees

* A **2.5% fee** is applied when staking or unstaking from reward pools.

#### 🎯 5. Reward Pool Participation

* Each reward pool collects:
  * Trading fees from $SPTs within that pool (bonding curve + DEX)
  * Sales of $SPTs — with a portion **sold to fund leaderboard stablecoin payouts**, and a larger portion **distributed back as staking rewards** to its own $SPT pools
  * Fees from staking and unstaking activity
  * Protocol-generated **Sporties** as contribution incentives

### 🧠 Protocol Expenses & Redistribution

SVM ensures long-term sustainability through a fixed breakdown of protocol revenue:

* **30%** → Sent to the **DAO Treasury** to fund operations and future initiatives
* **50%** → Distributed as **rewards to $SPT and $SVM holders**
* **20%** → Used to **burn $SVM**, reducing total supply over time

This model creates a deflationary pressure on $SVM, while also rewarding long-term holders and ensuring protocol development.

### 🏟️ Reward Pools by Competition

SVM maintains a separate **reward pool for each sport, competition, or league.**

* Example: Premier League players earn into the Premier League pool; La Liga into La Liga, etc.
* This ensures fairness and relevance in rewards, and avoids cross-league dilution.

Additionally, **30% of every stablecoin leaderboard payout** is used to **buy back and burn the top-performing $SPT** for that pool — making $SPTs **deflationary over time if they perform well.**
