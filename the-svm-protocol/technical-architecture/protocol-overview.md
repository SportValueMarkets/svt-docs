# Protocol Overview

Sport Value Market (SVM) is a decentralized protocol for creating tradable, stakeable markets around real-world sport performance. From footballers to F1 drivers to dancers and beyond — if their performance creates fans, **SVM turns it into programmable value**.

Each supported sport star gets their own fixed-supply token — a **Sport Performance Token (SPT)** — that can be bought, staked, and earned from, without placing a bet or taking on loss. Fans become stakeholders. Performance becomes on-chain logic. And the protocol does the rest.

> It’s not betting. It’s not fantasy. It’s sportfi infrastructure — running on smart contracts, not spreadsheets.

#### 🧩 What SVM Powers

SVM provides the infrastructure to:

* **Tokenize sport performance** — with fixed-supply, bonding-curve ERC-20s tied to individual stars
* **Enable no-loss staking** — where fans earn rewards based on real-world stats
* **Distribute rewards and airdrops** — transparently, automatically, and on-chain
* **Govern expansion and economics** — through a DAO powered by the upcoming $SVM token

The result: a protocol where anyone can back the performers they believe in — and win when they’re right.

#### 🔁 The Core Mechanisms

**🏅 SPTs (Sport Performance Tokens)**

Every supported athlete or sport figure has an SPT — a token whose value flows from a mix of **hype, performance, and on-chain engagement**.

* Tradable
* Stakeable
* Fixed supply
* Performance-indexed
* Airdrop-integrated

> Every SPT is a micro-economy — built on real fandom and transparent scoring.

**🪙 Sporties**

Sporties are SVM’s internal point system — earned through participation (staking, referrals, trading, social engagement) and used to access token airdrops.

They’re non-transferable, sybil-resistant, and serve as a cross-protocol engagement layer.

**🧠 $SVM (Coming Soon)**

$SVM will be the protocol’s governance and utility token — used to vote, direct treasury usage, and shape the protocol’s roadmap.

It’s not live yet — it will launch when staking, airdrops, and SPT markets are mature enough to support DAO participation.

***

#### ⚙️ All On-Chain

The protocol uses:

* Modular smart contracts to manage token minting, staking, scoring, and airdrops
* A structured scoring system to convert real-world performance into on-chain payouts
* A centralized-but-verifiable data provider to feed match stats and performance events into the protocol
* Secure upgrade logic (via multi-sigs and timelocks) until DAO governance is live

No backend toggles. No centralized reward ops. Just performance → score → payout.

***

#### 🧱 Built to Scale

Every SPT launch triggers a new flywheel:

1. Tokens are minted
2. Fans stake and engage
3. Sporties flow
4. Airdrops fire
5. Revenue grows
6. DAO expands
7. Another athlete launches

It’s infinitely repeatable, community-owned, and composable with any app, game, or marketplace built on top.

> Each new token is a campaign. Each campaign grows the protocol.

***

#### 🏁 TL;DR

* Tradable tokens tied to sport star performance
* Stake for rewards — no betting, no loss
* Earn Sporties → enter airdrops
* DAO-powered governance via $SVM (launching later)
* Modular, transparent, and built to launch hundreds of markets

**This is sport rewritten as protocol.**\
**This is SVM.**
