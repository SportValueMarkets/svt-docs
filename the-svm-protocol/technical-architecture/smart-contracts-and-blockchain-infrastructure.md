# Smart Contracts & Blockchain Infrastructure

Smart contracts are the operational backbone of SVM. Every token, every airdrop, every stake, every score — it's all enforced, executed, and logged on-chain.

No backend switches. No human distribution. Just transparent logic, modular design, and a permissionless stack built for scale.

***

#### 🧱 Modular Smart Contract Architecture

SVM is built on a modular smart contract system. Each contract governs a specific piece of the protocol — and each piece is designed to evolve independently.

This design provides:

* **Upgradability**\
  Contracts can be improved without full redeployments — gated by multisigs now, by the DAO later.
* **Security Isolation**\
  Logic is separated across components — so bugs don’t cascade, and risks stay contained.
* **Transparency**\
  Every contract is externally verifiable. You can inspect the code, track the inputs, and watch the system move in real time.

> Clean boundaries. Composable logic. Fully on-chain from end to end.

#### 🧩 Core Contract Modules

SVM’s smart contract system includes:

* **SPT Contracts**\
  Minting, burning, and transferring of fixed-supply ERC-20s for each supported sport star.
* **Staking Contracts**\
  Manage no-loss staking: lock tokens, calculate weights, and track performance-linked reward flows.
* **Reward Engine**\
  Converts scoring outcomes into on-chain distributions based on stake weight and match output.
* **Sporties Engine**\
  Tracks all points earned from staking, trading, referrals, or campaign activity — pre-conversion to claimable rewards.
* **Governance Contracts** _(pending $SVM launch)_\
  Set up to handle proposal creation, voting logic, and treasury execution.
* **Airdrop Allocator**\
  Verifies eligibility and distributes airdrops based on allocated Sporties and campaign rules.

Each of these contracts operates independently — but plugs into the shared state machine that makes SVM run.

#### ⚙️ EVM Infrastructure

SVM is deployed on Ethereum-compatible blockchains to maximize:

* **Wallet support** (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
* **Tooling access** (The Graph, Dune, public RPCs)
* **Liquidity integrations** (DEXs, LPs, dashboards)

The protocol is optimized for:

* **Gas efficiency** — lightweight operations and lean logic
* **UX** — seamless interaction with DeFi tools and wallets
* **Scalability** — deployable across L2s and sidechains as needed

> Wherever there’s EVM support, SVM can plug in and scale.

#### 🛠 Future-Proof Design

* 🔁 Upgradeable where needed — secured by multi-sig and timelock
* 🔒 Immutable where critical — to prevent tampering or centralized override
* 🧠 Transitioning to DAO governance once $SVM is live

Until then, every contract is secured, isolated, and accountable — and every action it takes is recorded forever on-chain.

***

#### 🏁 TL;DR

* Modular smart contract system — each function is isolated and auditable
* Lean, gas-efficient logic optimized for real usage
* Runs on EVM chains — ready for future multichain deployment
* Designed for DAO governance, secure upgradeability, and full transparency

> SVM isn’t just on-chain. It’s **built as a protocol from day one** — with contracts that run the game, not just power the UI.
