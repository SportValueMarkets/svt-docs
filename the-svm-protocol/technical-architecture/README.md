# 🛠️ Technical Architecture

The Sport Value Market (SVM) protocol is a modular, EVM-compatible infrastructure layer that turns athlete performance into programmable value — and gives fans a fully on-chain system to stake, earn, and build.

Smart contracts handle staking, scoring, airdrops, and rewards. External data feeds drive performance logic. Everything is built for composability, scale, and community control.

#### 🧱 Modular Smart Contract Design

SVM uses a clean, modular contract system. Each component — minting, staking, reward distribution, airdrop allocation — is separated into dedicated contracts. This allows:

* **Independent upgrades**: No monoliths. Each module evolves on its own.
* **Feature injection**: Add new logic (e.g. staking multipliers, boost mechanics) without affecting core functions.
* **Security isolation**: Bugs in one contract don’t compromise the entire system.

Contracts follow battle-tested ERC standards (like ERC-20), extended with custom logic for bonding curves, staking states, and dynamic scoring payout mechanics.

#### ⚙️ EVM-Based, Multichain Ready

SVM is deployed on EVM-compatible blockchains to maximize tooling support, wallet integration, and developer familiarity. This includes:

* Seamless onboarding with MetaMask or WalletConnect
* Support for on-chain indexing tools (The Graph, Dune, etc.)
* Future readiness for L2 deployments or sidechains

The smart contract architecture supports **per-chain player deployments**, meaning athlete token ecosystems can scale across chains without protocol duplication.

#### 📊 Real-World Data → On-Chain Logic

Player performance is scored using **verified match data** from a trusted sports data provider.

* Data includes granular in-match events (goals, assists, interceptions, etc.)
* Each stat is mapped to a **scoring matrix**, updated and governed by the DAO
* Scoring outputs are fed into on-chain reward logic for $SPT staking and airdrops

This creates a fully transparent system: everyone sees the inputs, the scoring rules, and the rewards.

***

#### 🔐 Security Controls & DAO Transition

SVM’s current architecture includes:

* **Multi-sig control** for upgradeable contracts
* **Timelocks** for changes, ensuring visibility and reaction time
* **Permission boundaries**: only designated contracts can call sensitive functions
* **DAO transition plan** to move governance and upgrades to token holders post-$SVM launch

Until then, protocol changes are transparent, scoped, and time-buffered — with an explicit path to full decentralization.

#### 🛠 Open Infrastructure for Builders

The protocol is fully composable:

* On-chain data (scores, stakes, airdrops) is publicly queryable
* Contracts are externally callable — enabling integrations with dashboards, games, analytics layers
* Stats and scores can be plugged into third-party dApps, meme tools, or fantasy layers

> It’s not a black box. It’s an open playground.

***

#### 🏁 TL;DR

* Modular smart contract architecture — staking, rewards, airdrops, and token logic separated by design
* EVM-first deployment — full tooling, multichain scalability, wallet compatibility
* Verified stat inputs + transparent scoring matrix → on-chain payouts
* Secure upgrade paths via multi-sig + timelock, with DAO transition baked in
* Fully composable and integration-ready for external builders

> It’s sport as code. Performance as logic. Fandom as infrastructure.
