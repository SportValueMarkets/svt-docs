# Scoring and Payouts

Whenever a player token is staked, it is eligible for performance related payouts. Payouts are not paid on each event, but they accrue an amount that can be redeemed any time. When a token is staked, the user gets a receipt token. This is a pretty standard way of operating in DEFI and it offers technical implementation advantages but it also offers composability. The staked version of a token can be used elsewhere. A certain amount of the tokens is purchased by the rewards pool from the market (DEX) and is then burned. That allows token holders who didnâ€™t stake their tokens to get some of the rewards indirectly. This also contributes to the price appreciation of the token.\


The payout depends on the score of a player and the available funds in the payout pool.  There is a payout amount for each player that is shared by  the token holders.



For a specific game:

Payout(player) = score(player,game) / sumOfAllScores(game) \* payoutFunds(game)



Payout(user, player) = numberOfStakedTokens(user, player) / totalNumberOfTokens(player) \* payout(player)



The score is a calculator using a scoring matrix borrowed from fantasy sports. The score is also adjusted relative to different leagues.
