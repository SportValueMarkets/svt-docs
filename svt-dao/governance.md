# Governance

The SVT ecosystem is controlled by SVC token holders who submit and vote on off-chain proposals that govern the ecosystem. Proposals that generate majority support (>50% of the vote) are implemented by a multi-signature wallet. The members of the multi-signature wallet (DAO management committee) are voted in by SVC holders  and are subject to change from future governance votes. In order to get voting rights, SVC tokens need to be staked.

What is typically voted on:

* Budgets and spending decisions
* New features and product decisions
* Key partnerships
* Appointments

The DAO will have its own treasury, controlled by the DAO managing committee member, using a multisig wallet. Spending decisions will be voted by token holders. The treasury is funded from initial token sales, protocol revenues and investments.
