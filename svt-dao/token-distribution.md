# Token Distribution

The governance tokens (SVC) are distributed to different groups of holders. The initial SVC token supply is fixed at 1,000,000,000. This amount may be reduced over time through token burning. The tokens are also locked and follow a vesting schedule. This is to ensure the right incentives and to prevent early investors or founders from dumping all their tokens at once (sometimes referred as rug pull). Different groups have different locking and vesting schedules.



The vesting and locking is actually enforced by smart contracts on chain, rather than on paper, and thus guaranteeing full transparency and enforceability of those rules.
