# Tokenomics

The initial SVC token supply is fixed at 1,000,000,000. This amount may be reduced over time through token burning.



New token issuance:

* There is regular issuance of SVC that is sent to the payout fund. The inflationary pressure that is generated is compensated by the token burning. This can even make SVC deflationary.

Fees:

* Funds from the initial player token sale are held in the treasury and the treasury provides liquidity for the DEX, which generates additional revenue
* Staking of player tokens requires fees (amount in not decided yet)
* Performance payouts are also charged with a 10% fee\


Fee distribution:

* 50% goes into the treasury to fund DAO operations
* 25% is used to pay reward to SVC stakers
* 25% is used to burn SVC tokens

Those values can be changed following a governance vote.
