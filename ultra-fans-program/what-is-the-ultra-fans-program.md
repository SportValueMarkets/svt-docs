# 👸 What is the Ultra Fans Program

**Ultra Fans** are the beating heart of the SVM movement — not just supporters, but early builders of the sportfi revolution.

This isn’t a traditional ambassador program. It’s not about copy-pasting shill threads or collecting vanity titles. **Ultra Fans are sports lovers turned leaders**, culture-shapers, meme lords, raid captains, and on-chain loyalists who want to help reinvent fandom from the ground up.

> If you’ve ever yelled “We should get a cut for this,” welcome home.\
> If you knew that athlete was going to blow up before anyone else, this is your arena.\
> If you believe sports fans deserve **ownership, rewards, and power** — this is your chance.

### 🔥 Why Ultra Fans Exist

The SVM protocol is open, decentralized, and built to scale globally — but protocols don’t build culture. People do. And to make SVM go viral, to make **Player Tokens** the next big thing, we need an army of real ones.

Ultra Fans exist to:

* Spread the sportfi gospel
* Turn local fanbases into on-chain movements
* Lead campaigns, raids, memes, and missions
* Help onboard the next 1,000,000 users to fan-owned finance

### 🌍 A Global Movement of Fan-Led Ownership

Anyone, anywhere can apply. Ultra Fans are chosen for their passion, creativity, and hustle — not their follower count. Whether you’re in a Telegram group in Turkey or a Discord in Brazil, your mission is the same: **bring the fire, bring the fans, and grow the game.**

SVM is betting on people like you to make this the most viral, sticky, fan-powered launch in crypto history. And we’re backing it with:

* Dedicated airdrop allocations just for Ultra Fans
* Unique roles, badges, and early governance status
