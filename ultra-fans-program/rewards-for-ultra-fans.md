# Rewards for Ultra Fans

If you're helping build the sportfi revolution, you're not doing it for likes — you're doing it for the culture, the rewards, and the upside.\
**Ultra Fans don’t get paid (yet). But they do get recognized, rewarded, and remembered.**

***

### 🪂 Ultra Fan Points → Exclusive Airdrops

Ultra Fans earn **Ultra Fan Points (UFP)** — a separate reward system just for ambassadors.

* 🔐 These points are **not transferable**, but they **unlock exclusive airdrop allocations** reserved only for the Ultra Fan squad.
* 🎯 Each SPT airdrop includes an **additional 5% pool** (on top of the public airdrop) allocated solely for Ultra Fans.
* 🧠 Allocation works just like normal Sporties:
  * 80% of the pool is distributed proportionally based on UFP spent
  * 20% is distributed via **Base Airdrop Guarantee (BAG)** if a minimum threshold is met

This system ensures Ultra Fans **own a piece of every campaign they help grow** — without fighting for scraps in the public pool.

### 🧢 Beyond the Airdrops: Ultra Fan Perks

Being early means more than earning — it means status, access, and identity. Ultra Fans can unlock:

* 🧢 **Exclusive SVM merch** (limited drops for top contributors)
* 🎖️ **OG Discord roles**, badges, and NFT-based credentials
* 📬 **Private chats** with the SVM core team

### 🧠 Your Effort = Your Edge

The more you contribute, the more you earn — and the more your digital reputation grows inside the SVM ecosystem.

> You’re not just earning rewards. You’re earning status, influence, and the right to say:\
> &#xNAN;**“I helped build this before it 1,000x’d.”**
