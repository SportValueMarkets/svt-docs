# 🔮 Future Growth & Roles

**Ultra Fans aren’t static.** They evolve — from early supporters to leaders, organizers, and eventually core contributors shaping the future of SVM.

As the protocol grows, so will the ambassador program. We’ve intentionally kept it lightweight, off-chain, and flexible — so it can scale with the community and adapt to what’s needed most.

***

### 🧠 The Role System (Core Stack)

We’ve defined a handful of key roles — not as rigid titles, but as a **ladder of trust, impact, and opportunity**:

#### 🟢 **Ultra Fan**

* The base role — all approved ambassadors start here
* Gain access to quests, private chats, and UFP-based rewards

#### 🔵 **Scout**

* Help identify and bring in new Ultra Fans
* Support regional growth, especially in emerging sports scenes

#### 🟡 **Coach**

* Onboard new Ultra Fans and community members
* Share tips, guidance, and ensure smooth activation

#### 🟠 **Referee**

* Help manage the Ultra Fans program directly
* Track progress, assist in planning events or pushes

#### 🟣 **Captain**

* Regional or sport-specific leaders
* Organize major raids, content drops, and country-level activations
* Note: Captains operate separately from SVT governance but can work alongside it

### 🎯 What Roles Unlock

Roles aren’t just for show — they unlock real perks:

* Extra **UFP rewards** for key tasks
* Access to **advanced campaigns and tools**
* Recognition across SVM’s public and internal systems
* Priority for **future DAO delegate slots** and **full time team positions**

> The more you give, the more you get — in access, impact, and upside.

### 🚀 What’s Coming Next

As the Ultra Fans program evolves, we’re exploring:

* ⚙️ A **reputation layer** tied to on-chain actions and task history
* 📜 A **contribution logbook** with verifiable records of involvement
* 🧩 **On-chain roles** that plug into the broader SVM governance system
* 🏗 A **lightweight coordination DAO** for top-tier contributors

None of this is mandatory. You can be as active or as chill as you want.\
But if you **want to lead the sportfi revolution from the front**, there’s a path — and it starts now.
