## Campaigns

Currently we are running a points reward program on Zealy: [https://zealy.io/cw/sportvaluetokens/questboard](https://zealy.io/cw/sportvaluetokens/questboard)

and Galxe: [https://app.galxe.com/quest/HnqVD3buQxYCpstYw6ALWP](https://app.galxe.com/quest/HnqVD3buQxYCpstYw6ALWP)&#x20;

These points will exchanged for tokens (SVC) after the TGE. See in token distribution section, the number of tokens allocated to the community (airdrops).
