# Community Rewards

## Pre-launch Rewards

The community members are rewarded for every action:

* sharing
* commenting
* sharing ideas and providing feedback
* voting
* finding bugs

Currently we are running a points reward program on Zealy: [https://zealy.io/cw/sportvaluetokens/questboard](https://zealy.io/cw/sportvaluetokens/questboard)

These points will exchanged for tokens (SVC) after the TGE. See in token distribution section, the number of tokens allocated to the community (airdrops).

## Post-launch rewards

Community rewards will stay forever, but the rewars may be adjusted based on the available budget.

Trading, staking, providing liquidity will lead to rewards in SVC

There will be also trading competitions and different prizes.
