A glossary of key terms, components, and systems that power the Sport Value Market (SVM) protocol.

***

#### **$SPT â€“ Sport Performance Token**

ERC-20 tokens that represent the performance of real-world athletes. Each $SPT is:

* Tied to a single athlete
* Issued with a fixed total supply
* Tradable and stakeable
* Eligible for rewards based on performance

***

#### **$SVM â€“ Governance Token**

The governance token of the SVM protocol. Used for voting, treasury decisions, DAO participation, and protocol ownership.

***

#### **Sporties**

A non-transferable point system earned through actions across the protocol: staking, trading, Free-to-Play, referrals, quests, and more. Sporties can be used to enter airdrops and unlock access to exclusive benefits.

***

#### **Issuance Contract**

The smart contract that issues $SPTs using a bonding curve model. It:

* Sets initial pricing and supply dynamics
* Allocates part of the supply to the treasury
* Sends liquidity to DEX pools post-curve

***

#### **Bonding Curve**

A pricing mechanism where token price increases as supply is purchased. Enables fair early access and prevents massive sniping.

***

#### **Token Vault**

Where $SPTs are staked. Each $SPT has its own vault. Vaulted tokens earn payouts from the Rewards Pool based on athlete performance.

***

#### **Scoring System**

The logic that translates real-world performance into on-chain scoring for each $SPT. Scoring determines reward eligibility and is driven by data from trusted oracles.

***

#### **Oracles**

Services that feed off-chain athlete stats into the blockchain. SVM integrates with multiple oracle sources to avoid single points of failure.

***

#### **Stats Providers**

External data partners that provide verified real-life stats (goals, assists, minutes, etc.) used by the scoring system.

***

#### **Rewards Pool**

Smart contract responsible for distributing rewards to staked $SPTs. Each competition or league has its own reward pool, funded by trading fees, staking fees, $SPT sales, and Sporties.

***

#### **Treasury**

The DAO-managed treasury that receives protocol revenue. It funds operations, pays contributors, provides liquidity, and redistributes value to token holders.

***

#### **DEX â€“ Decentralized Exchange**

Where $SPTs are traded once the bonding curve cap is reached. Fees generated from trades help fund rewards and treasury growth.

***

#### **Free-to-Play dApp (F2P)**

A no-wallet entry point to SVM where users receive 1,000 SVP (Sport Value Points) and compete on weekly leaderboards. Sporties earned here can be used to access crypto airdrops.

***

#### **SVP â€“ Sport Value Points**

An internal currency used in the F2P app to simulate token trading. Not a token. Used to acquire Free $SPTs and climb leaderboards.

***

#### **Ultra Fans Program**

SVMâ€™s ambassador program for contributors across content, community, and strategy. Participants earn Ultra Fan Points and exclusive airdrop access.
