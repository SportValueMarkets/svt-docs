# ⚖️ Legal & Compliance

SVM is committed to building a sustainable and compliant protocol that empowers fans and athletes — without cutting corners. While we aim to stay decentralized and accessible, we also recognize the importance of adhering to evolving global standards in crypto, finance, and sports.

***

#### 🧾 **Not a Betting Platform**

SVM does **not** offer gambling or betting services.\
Our staking mechanisms are **non-loss based**:

* Fans earn yield based on real-world athlete performance.
* No wagers, no odds, no losses — only variable rewards.
* It’s DeFi-inspired fan participation, not gambling.

This makes SVM fundamentally different from sportsbooks and fantasy betting platforms.

***

#### 🌐 **SPTs as Utility Tokens**

Sports Performance Tokens (SPTs) are designed as **utility tokens**:

* They provide access to staking, Sporties generation, and airdrops.
* They are capped in supply (1M per athlete) and tradable.
* They are **not** investment contracts or shares.
* They serve as the fan’s bridge to athlete performance markets.

SPTs are backed by data and participation — not promises of profit or dividends.

***

#### 🪙 **SVT and DAO Governance**

The $SVT token will govern the SVM protocol once launched:

* All key upgrades, treasury spending, and new athlete approvals go through SVT-based DAO voting.
* SVT staking (via veSVT) unlocks protocol revenue sharing and governance access.
* No central authority will unilaterally control SVM after decentralization.

This model aligns with decentralized governance frameworks adopted by leading web3 projects.

***

#### 🚧 **Jurisdictional Awareness**

We are actively monitoring the legal landscape in key markets:

* Token sales and airdrops are designed to comply with jurisdictional guidelines.
* Sporties are non-transferable loyalty points — not tokens with monetary value.
* SVM may restrict access from certain regions if required for compliance.

Our goal is global access with smart compliance, not shortcuts.

***

#### 🤝 **Partners, Audits, and Frameworks**

We are pursuing the following protections:

* Smart contract audits by reputable firms
* Legal review of tokenomics, DAO mechanics, and staking
* Partnerships with regulatory-compliant infrastructure providers
* Long-term decentralization roadmaps and non-custodial tools

***

#### 📌 TL;DR

* **SVM is not gambling.**
* **SPTs are utility tokens, not securities.**
* **Sporties are loyalty points, not currency.**
* **SVT governance will decentralize decision-making.**
* **Compliance and decentralization are baked into the roadmap.**
