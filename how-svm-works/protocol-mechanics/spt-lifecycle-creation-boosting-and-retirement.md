# SPT Lifecycle: Creation, Boosting, & Retirement

**Every athlete’s token has a story — from launch hype to final whistle.**

SVM is the first protocol that turns athletes into on-chain assets — and each **SPT (Sport Player Token)** follows a dynamic, decentralized lifecycle.\
This keeps the system fresh, fair, and filled with high-signal opportunities for fans and speculators alike.

***

### 🛠️ 1. Creation: Launching New Player Tokens

Every SPT starts with a fan-fueled launch, where community members propose and vote (via $SVM) on new athlete tokens.

Once approved:

* The SPT is deployed on-chain using a **bonding curve**
* Airdrop campaign is activated
* Token supply is fixed at launch (typically 1M units)
* Performance vault is initialized for weekly rewards

> No random mints. No endless inflation. Every SPT is launched with intent, community backing, and real performance upside.

### 🚀 2. Boosting: Growth Through Performance + Hype

Once live, the token enters its active phase — where it can be bought, staked, traded, and hyped.

Here’s what drives value:

* 🏆 Real-world performance = staking rewards
* 📈 Market demand = price action via bonding curve
* 🧠 Fan strategy = Sporties, airdrops, referrals
* 🔁 On-chain activity = protocol revenue, DAO growth

Certain SPTs may receive **temporary boost multipliers** based on trending performance, league events, or community campaigns.

> This is where sports, data, and meme energy combine to create wild upsides for the most insightful fans.

### 🧹 3. Deprecation: Phasing Out Retired or Inactive Players

Not all athletes stay in the spotlight forever. SVM accounts for that.

SPTs can enter **deprecation mode** if:

* The player retires
* They become inactive for a long period (TBD by DAO)
* Their performance falls below a system-defined threshold

Deprecation rules:

* Token remains tradable, but vault rewards stop
* Protocol may reallocate emissions to active SPTs
* Historical staking data remains visible and on-chain

> You’ll never lose your tokens. But performance rewards are for the active era — not the archives.

***

### 🧠 DAO-Controlled, Market-Driven

The SPT lifecycle is governed by both:

* **DAO voting** (for launches, deprecations, and boosts)
* **User demand** (trading, staking, Sporties usage)

This creates a flexible, replayable system where:

* 🏁 New tokens constantly launch
* 🔄 Old ones cycle out
* 📊 Value flows toward athletes making real impact — in sport _and_ in hype

> It’s not just a lifecycle. It’s an infinite loop of speculation, support, and sport-powered opportunity.

***

### 🏁 TL;DR

* **Creation:** Tokens are launched via DAO proposals + bonding curves
* **Boosting:** Active phase = rewards, trading, campaigns, and hype
* **Deprecation:** Retired/inactive players are phased out, but tokens live on
* **Repeat:** The SVM ecosystem continuously evolves with the real-world sports cycle

**This is how fandom becomes finance — and how every athlete gets a chance to become an asset.**
