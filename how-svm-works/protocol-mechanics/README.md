# 📟 Protocol Mechanics

**How fandom turns into finance — and hype becomes yield.**

At the heart of SVM is a set of powerful, transparent mechanics that **turn sports moments into on-chain value**. No hidden odds. No middlemen. Just smart contracts, staking, and speculation — designed for fans, fueled by activity, and governed by the community.

***

### 🧩 The Core Mechanisms

SVM brings together four foundational pillars:

#### 🪙 1. SPTs (Athlete Tokens)

* Fixed-supply tokens tied to real athletes
* Minted via bonding curve at launch, tradable post-mint
* Prices increase as demand grows
* Tradeable on supported DEXs
* Stakeable for performance-based rewards

> Every player is a meme, market, and investment — all in one.

***

#### 🔁 2. No-Loss Staking Vaults

* Stake SPTs to earn weekly rewards based on real-life performance
* No downside: you always keep your tokens
* Rewards come from protocol revenue, not other users' losses
* Performance scores and reward formulas are transparent and on-chain

> It’s staking, not gambling — and every week, your fandom gets tested.

***

#### 🪂 3. Airdrop Engine

* Every new SPT launch is paired with an airdrop campaign
* Earn Sporties (points) through social or on-chain actions
* Allocate Sporties to specific player drops
* Claim tokens based on:
  * **80%** proportional to Sporties spent
  * **20%** via Base Airdrop Guarantee (BAG) — equal for all eligible users

> The more you do, the more you get — but there’s always a floor.

***

#### 🧠 4. Sporties: The Reward Layer

* Non-transferable points that track your engagement
* Earned through:
  * Buying, staking, LPing
  * Referrals
  * Social quests and platform campaigns
* Redeemable in any live airdrop pool
* Stored and managed on-chain for transparency

> Sporties are your meta-currency. Spend them where it matters most.

### 📡 Data, Oracles & Scores

SVM is powered by real-time data and decentralized logic.

* Live match stats are pulled from oracle feeds
* Performance scores are calculated per athlete each week
* Scores directly influence staking rewards
* Transparent formula = no guessing, no foul play

> We turn stats into yield — not just entertainment.

***

### 🔁 Cyclical, Scalable, and Permissionless

The beauty of SVM lies in its **repeatability**:

* New athletes = new tokens
* New tokens = new campaigns
* More campaigns = more Sporties, more airdrops, more users

And it’s all:

* On-chain
* Open
* Globally accessible

> It’s not just a platform. It’s a protocol with **infinite replay value**.

***

### 🏁 TL;DR

* SVM uses bonding curves, staking, and airdrops to fuel its ecosystem
* Rewards are based on data, not luck
* You never lose your tokens — but you can win big with your insights
* Every season, player, and match = a new opportunity

**This is how sportfi works — and we’re just getting warmed up.**
