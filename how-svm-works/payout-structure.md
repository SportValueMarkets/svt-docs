# 💲 Payout Structure

The SVM reward system is designed to align incentives across all levels of participation — from casual free-to-play users to active token stakers. It combines guaranteed rewards for participation, gradual token emissions, and performance-based bonuses tied to protocol growth.

#### 🎯 1. Guaranteed Participation Rewards (Sporties)

Every on-chain action you take in the protocol earns **Sporties**, the non-transferable points used for airdrop access, referral status, and other benefits. These are predictable and guaranteed:

* Stake $SPTs → earn Sporties
* Refer users → earn Sporties
* Trade or complete quests → earn Sporties

There is **no performance requirement** — if you participate, you earn.

#### 🪙 2. $SPT Token Emissions (Staking Rewards)

A portion of each athlete's $SPT supply is distributed **weekly** to all stakers. This distribution follows a **fixed emission schedule**:

* Total rewards decrease each week (deflationary design)
* Rewards are pooled and split among stakers proportionally

This means:

* The more total stake in the pool, the smaller your share.
* Long-term stakers benefit from compounding Sporties and early access to higher emissions.

While these rewards are meaningful, they are designed to avoid unsustainable APRs. Too-high yield would reduce token value — so emissions are significant, but responsible.

#### 🏆 3. Performance-Based Bonuses (Protocol Revenue Share)

A portion of protocol fees is allocated weekly to the **top-performing $SPTs** — meaning the athletes whose tokens have the highest scoring performance for the leagues, sport, and/or competition.

* Distributed based on leaderboard rankings
* Rewards go to stakers of the best-performing athletes
* Size of this pool increases over time as protocol revenue grows

In addition to regular staking rewards, the top-performing $SPTs on each leaderboard are eligible for special bonuses funded by a portion of protocol revenue.

Leaderboards can be scoped to a **league**, a **competition**, or an entire **sport** — and a single $SPT can appear on multiple leaderboards at once. For example, an athlete might rank on both their **league leaderboard** and the **overall football leaderboard**.

Each leaderboard defines its own bonus range — such as **Top 10**, **Top 100**, or another cut-off — and rewards are distributed accordingly based on performance scores.

> This layered system ensures the most impactful $SPTs are continuously rewarded across all levels of the ecosystem.

This ties real-world performance directly to on-chain value and incentivizes users to identify and stake on breakout Sport Stars.

#### 🕹️ 4. Free-to-Play Payouts

The Free-to-Play (F2P) dApp follows a similar leaderboard model, but with its own independent reward structure:

* Each gameweek, users are ranked based on their SVP-backed portfolios
* The top performers receive **Sporties** and **bonus SVP**

These rewards are exclusive to F2P and do not involve tokens or wallets.

> While there is no on-chain interaction, the same core mechanics apply: strategy, selection, and real-world performance define your rank — and your rewards.

#### 💡 Summary

| Action                     | Reward Type      | Notes                                        |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Stake $SPTs                | Sporties         | Guaranteed, increases airdrop access         |
| Stake $SPTs                | $SPTs            | Fixed weekly emissions, decreasing over time |
| Stake Top-Performing $SPTs | Protocol Revenue | Leaderboard-based, scales with protocol      |

This system rewards:

* **Everyone who participates**, regardless of outcome
* **Committed stakers** who remain active long-term
* **Skilled selectors** who back high-performing athletes

Together, these mechanics balance reliability and merit — and ensure long-term alignment between users, tokens, and the protocol.
