# 🪂 Airdrop Mechanics

**Airdrops are your chance to earn ownership — and build your portfolio of Player Tokens.**

Every new **SPT (Sport Player Token)** launches with a dedicated airdrop campaign, giving fans a way to earn their share of tokens through real participation — not speculation.

While some tokens are allocated to private sales, athlete partners, or liquidity, a guaranteed **public airdrop pool** is always reserved for the community — plus a bonus pool for our most dedicated supporters.

### 🔁 The Airdrop Campaign Flow

You can earn **Sporties** anytime by engaging with the SVM ecosystem. When a new athlete is announced, you’ll use those Sporties to claim your stake.

Each airdrop follows this four-phase flow:

#### 1. 🕓 Pre-Launch Phase

A new SPT is announced. You’ll get:

* Launch details
* Allocation window timeline
* Strategy tips and reminders

> Start saving or planning your Sporties allocation.

#### 2. 🧮 Allocation Phase

You decide how many Sporties to commit to this airdrop.

* Choose your allocation (use as many or as few Sporties as you want)
* Each airdrop has a minimum to qualify for BAG
* You can allocate across multiple SPT airdrops at once

#### 3. 📊 Calculation Phase

After the allocation window closes:

* The protocol tallies everyone’s allocated Sporties
* Airdrop shares are calculated

#### 4. 🪂 Distribution Phase

Once the SPT finishes its bonding curve sale (becomes freely tradable):

* The airdrop pool unlocks
* Claim your tokens on-chain
* Start trading, staking, or holding

> No early claims — tokens are only distributed after the full launch cycle is complete.

### 🎯 Airdrop Distribution Breakdown

#### 🔹 80% — Proportional Pool

Divided based on how many Sporties you spent compared to others.

> Spend more = earn more. Every Sportie counts.

#### 🔸 20% — **Base Airdrop Guarantee (BAG)**

Split evenly among all participants who meet the **minimum Sporties threshold spent on the airdrop**.

> Even smaller players get rewarded — as long as they participate meaningfully.

### 🔵 Ultra Fan Bonus Airdrop

🧢 **Ultra Fans** (our ambassador force) earn from a special side pool:

* \~**5% of each SPT airdrop**
* Based on **Ultra Fan Points (UFP)** earned through their help for community growth, campaigns, and overall contributions
* Claimable in parallel with the main drop

> Support the movement. Get paid like a builder.

### 💬 What About Private Sales?

Yes — some SPT tokens are reserved for:

* Athlete partnerships
* Liquidity provisioning
* Strategic early backers

But **public participation is always guaranteed** through the airdrop system. Fans are the foundation — and every launch honors that.

***

### 🏁 TL;DR

* Earn Sporties through engagement anytime
* Allocate them during airdrop campaigns
* 80% of the airdrop is proportional to what you spend
* 20% uses the BAG model for qualifying users
* Ultra Fans get a dedicated 5% bonus pool
* All claims happen **after the bonding curve completes** and the token is live

**Airdrops aren’t a marketing stunt. They’re the front door to on-chain fandom.**
