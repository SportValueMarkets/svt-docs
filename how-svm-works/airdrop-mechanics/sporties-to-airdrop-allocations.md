# Sporties to Airdrop Allocations

_“You earn. You allocate. You claim. That’s the game.”_

***

### 🧠 The Core Idea

Every time a new Player Token (SPT) is launched, an airdrop campaign opens — and **you decide how many Sporties to allocate** into that pool.

Your allocation determines how much of the airdrop you get, based on a transparent split:

***

### ⚖️ The 80/20 Airdrop Model

#### 🔹 80% — **Proportional Allocation**

The majority of the drop is distributed **based on how many Sporties you allocate compared to others**.

> If you contribute 10% of total Sporties in a pool, you get 10% of the 80%.

This rewards:

* Dedicated fans
* Early builders and power users
* Long-term Sporties stackers

***

#### 🔸 20% — **Base Airdrop Guarantee (BAG)**

To make it fair for smaller holders or new users, **20% is split equally** between anyone who hits a minimum Sporties threshold.

> Equal share — as long as you qualify.

This ensures:

* Everyone gets a slice
* Newcomers stay motivated
* Bots and whales don’t eat everything

> You can qualify for both the 80% and the 20%. No tradeoffs.

***

### 💡 Flexible by Design

There are **no forced spends or burns.**\
You decide when to deploy your Sporties and how much.

* Go all in on one athlete
* Spread across many
* Skip drops you don’t care about
* Save up for someone legendary

**Your Sporties, your strategy.**

***

### 🕒 Timing & Claims

Each airdrop campaign has three clear phases:

1. **Pre-Launch Preview**\
   The athlete is announced. You get the chance to plan your allocation.
2. **Sporties Allocation Window**\
   You commit how many Sporties you want to spend. This is open for a limited time.
3. **Distribution & Claim**\
   Once the SPT’s bonding curve is completed (and it’s tradable), the claim window opens.
   * **All claims are done after bonding curve completion**
   * Claim on-chain. No gas wars. No surprise drops.

### 🎁 Bonus for Ultra Fans

Each SPT airdrop also includes a dedicated pool for **Ultra Fans** — SVM’s ambassador program.

* **5% of the total airdrop** value is reserved
* Ultra Fan Points are used to compete for it
* Exclusive to active contributors and builders

### 🔁 Summary

* You earn Sporties anytime — on-chain + social
* You spend Sporties in airdrop pools you care about
* 80% = proportional split, 20% = guaranteed share (BAG)
* Airdrop claims happen **only after** the SPT is tradable
* Ultra Fans get their own allocation too

**It’s sports + strategy + sweat. And it pays.**
