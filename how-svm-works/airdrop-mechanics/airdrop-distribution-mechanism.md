# ⚖️ Airdrop Distribution Mechanism

_Predictable, transparent, and repeatable — not a gamble, but a game plan.”_

***

### 📦 Airdrops in SVM Aren’t Random

Each SPT (Player Token) airdrop follows a clear, public, and fair structure — ensuring the fans who put in the work get the rewards.

It’s all driven by **Sporties**, our ecosystem-wide point system.\
You earn. You allocate. You claim. Every time.

***

### ⏱️ Phase 1: Pre-Launch Window (Hype & Preparation)

An upcoming SPT is revealed:

* Player identity, token details, and airdrop timing go public
* You start planning: Will you allocate Sporties? How much?

🚨 **Note:**\
Sporties earning **continues** throughout this phase. You can build your stack at any time — even before allocation windows open.

***

### 🎯 Phase 2: Allocation Window (You Lock Your Sporties In)

During this period, you decide how many Sporties you want to allocate to this SPT’s airdrop campaign. You can:

* Go all-in on one drop
* Split across multiple
* Skip entirely and save for a later drop

Your allocation determines your airdrop share based on our 80/20 model (detailed below).

You can’t change your allocation after the window closes or remove Sporties already added to an allocation — so play it smart.

***

### 🧮 Phase 3: Calculation

After the allocation window ends:

* The system calculates your rewards:
  * **80% Proportional Airdrap Reward (PAR):** Based on your Sporties vs. total pool
  * **20% Base Airdrop Guarantee (BAG):** Equal share for all who passed a minimum threshold
* Ultra Fans’ **5% bonus pool** is calculated **separately**, using **Ultra Fan Points**, following the same 80/20 logic.

📊 Everything is transparent — you’ll see exactly how much you earned and why.

***

### 🚀 Phase 4: Claim (Only After Bonding Curve Ends)

SPTs launch with a **bonding curve** — meaning they go through price discovery and minting before being tradable.

🪙 **Claiming opens only once the bonding curve is completed.**

* Tokens become freely tradable
* You can now claim your airdrop
* No one can claim early — not even whales or insiders

Everyone enters the market at the same time. Clean and fair. So help us make each SPT graduate!

***

### 🔄 Ultra Fan Allocation

In addition to the main airdrop, there is a **+5% bonus airdrop pool** exclusively for Ultra Fans.\
It works the same way:

* Sporties = Ultra Fan Points
* Allocation = 80% PAR + 20% BAG
* Claimed after bonding curve ends

It’s not taken from the public pool — it’s extra. And Ultra Fans can participate in both airdrops.

> That’s what early contributors and community leaders deserve.

***

### 🔐 Why It Works

* You earn Sporties on your own time — no race to a snapshot
* You allocate how you want — total flexibility
* You only claim when markets are live — no fake liquidity and incentive for everyone to make SPTs graduate
* Bonus Ultra Fan pool adds long-term value to contribution
* No secret unlocks. No early claims. No BS.
