# Unified Airdrop Pools

**One system. Thousands of campaigns. Infinite upside.**

SVM is built to scale — not just in athletes, but in opportunities.

That’s why we don’t rebuild the wheel for every airdrop. Instead, we’ve created a **unified, repeatable pool system** that powers every token launch across the ecosystem.

> Different athletes. Same game. One core mechanic.

***

### ♻️ What Does “Unified” Mean?

Rather than designing a new process for each player, all SPT (Sport Player Token) airdrops follow the same structure:

* Same **Sporties** point system
* Same **allocation + BAG model**
* Same **claim logic after launch**
* Same interfaces, rules, and timelines

> If you’ve done one SPT airdrop — you know how to play them all.

This creates predictability, clarity, and speed of launch — while still allowing individual tokens to have **different earning durations, campaign content, or bonus rewards.**

***

### 🧩 Why This Matters

#### ✅ Scalable by Design

We’re launching hundreds — eventually thousands — of SPTs. This system means:

* No custom builds
* No new logic or rules
* Just add athlete → launch → reward

#### 🧠 Familiar for Users

* One dashboard
* One point system (Sporties)
* One set of rules\
  No confusion. Just compounding opportunity.

#### 💥 Stack Your Strategy

* Save Sporties between drops
* Allocate across multiple SPTs at once
* Experiment with high/low commitment strategies

You’re not starting over with each airdrop — you’re building a long-term fan portfolio.

### 🔗 Connected Across Ecosystem

Every part of the protocol feeds the pool system:

* Staking earns Sporties → Spend in drops
* Trading volume → Earn points
* Quests and raids → Extra allocation power
* Referrals → Amplify both your Sporties and your network

All of it points to one thing: **building your position in upcoming airdrops.**

***

### 🔄 Replayability = Retention

Every week brings new athletes, new campaigns, and new chances to win — but the system doesn’t change.

That means:

* You’re never starting from scratch
* You can optimize your own playbook
* You can stack gains over time

This isn’t a one-time airdrop. It’s a rolling engine of ownership and opportunity.

***

### 🏁 TL;DR

* Every SPT airdrop runs through the **same unified system**
* Earn Sporties, allocate them, and claim when live
* One mechanic → many players → infinite replayability
* Predictable for users, scalable for the protocol

**Welcome to the airdrop layer of on-chain fandom.**
