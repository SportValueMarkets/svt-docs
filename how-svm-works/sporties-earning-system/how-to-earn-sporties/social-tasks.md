# Social Tasks

**No tokens? No problem. Earn Sporties with nothing but internet and fandom.**

Before you stake, before you trade — you can **start earning** by just showing up, engaging, and proving you're one of the real ones.

Social Tasks are the _off-chain ramp_ into the SVM ecosystem.\
You’ll complete quests, earn XP, and later convert that XP into **Sporties** — the points that power all airdrop allocations.

### ⚙️ How It Works (For Now)

We’re starting with **Zealy** during our early pre-launch phase.\
You’ll:

* Complete social quests
* Earn XP
* XP gets converted to on-chain **Sporties** later

> 💡 XP → Sporties happens at the end of each campaign window.

### 📍 Future Plan: Switching to TaskOn

As we scale, we’ll **move to TaskOn** — a more advanced, token-compatible platform and a whitelabel that will allow us to propose those directly on our website.

On TaskOn:

* Tasks can directly reward you in **SPT or SVT tokens**
* Some actions will earn you **SVM Points**, redeemable in the SVM shop or leaderboard
* Everything will eventually link into our **on-chain Sporties system** automatically

***

### ✅ What Kind of Tasks?

Here’s what you’ll typically find:

* **Follow & Join**: Twitter, Telegram, Discord
* **Engage**: Like, repost, comment, participate in raids
* **Learn**: Read docs, watch explainers, take quizzes
* **Create**: Memes, fan content, sports takes, predictions
* **Refer**: Bring in new fans, onboard newcomers
* **Feedback**: Test features, give suggestions, report bugs

### 🎯 Why It Matters

Social tasks aren’t fluff — they’re **value creation**.\
You’re building the movement, and we’re tracking your impact.

> Every tweet, every friend onboarded, every meme that hits — it all stacks up to more Sporties… and bigger airdrops later.
