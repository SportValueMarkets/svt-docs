# Initial System & Future

Before we go fully on-chain, we’re kicking off with a lightweight, high-impact setup to reward our early community with Sporties and fuel the ecosystem’s takeoff.

This is the **warm-up phase** — and it’s where the most dedicated fans start stacking their edge.

***

### ⚙️ How It Works

In this initial phase, we’re using **Zealy** (and later **TaskOn**) to run quests, reward actions, and track activity.

You’ll:

* Complete tasks on Zealy
* Earn XP
* Convert that XP into **Sporties** when the on-chain system goes live

Simple as that.

***

### 🧩 Why This System

🕐 **Fast to launch** — no need to wait for custom infra\
🧠 **Clear tasks** — join Telegram, follow on X, post memes, drop feedback, etc.\
🏆 **Early community edge** — early activity = more Sporties when it counts\
🧪 **Test + learn** — we observe what works before scaling up on-chain

***

### 🎯 What You’ll Do

Early quests might include:

* Joining Telegram / Discord
* Following on X / Instagram / TikTok
* Completing onboarding flows
* Reading articles / watching videos
* Providing product feedback
* Posting memes or content
* Inviting others
* Participating in early discussions

💡 All actions are focused on **growing the community**, **rewarding real fans**, and **kickstarting culture**.

***

### 🔄 Conversion to Sporties

* XP is **snapshotted regularly**
* When we launch the full on-chain Sporties system, **XP → Sporties** at a ratio that keeps social tasks meaningful — but makes **in-protocol activity the core driver**
* You’ll **redeem your Sporties** through our dApp at launch

👉 **XP ≠ Sporties 1:1.** The conversion will reflect contribution AND help balance future airdrops.

***

### ⏩ What’s Next

After this phase:

* We’ll switch from Zealy to **TaskOn**, where tasks can be rewarded directly with tokens or points
* Eventually, we’ll deploy the **fully on-chain Sporties system**, with direct tracking, real-time point issuance, and seamless reward redemption

***

> This early system is **your head start**. The real game’s just beginning — but this is how you enter with momentum.

Start earning XP. Stack your edge. Be part of the day one crew.
