# Referrals

**Turn your network into your net worth.**

The SVM ecosystem thrives on community — and we believe those who help it grow should get rewarded. With our referral system, you earn **Sporties** from the people you bring in… and from the people _they_ bring in, too.

Let’s break it down:

***

### 🔗 How It Works

You get a unique **referral link**.\
Anyone who signs up via that link becomes your **referee**.

From there, you passively earn **Sporties** based on their actions in the ecosystem:

* Buying & staking SPTs
* Completing quests
* Providing liquidity (post-launch)
* And more…

***

### 💰 Direct Referral Rewards

You earn **10%** of all Sporties earned by each of your referees —\
but only for the **first 6 months** after they join.

⏳ Their 6-month reward window starts the day they sign up.\
⚠️ This bonus does **not** reduce their earnings — it’s an extra reward just for you.

***

### 🔁 Indirect Referral Rewards (Tier 2)

You also earn **1%** of the Sporties earned by your referees’ referrals (aka their downline).

However:\
⏳ You only earn Tier 2 rewards for the **first 12 months** after you referred your direct referee.

#### ✅ Example:

* You invite **Alex** today
* You earn 10% of all Alex’s Sporties for the next 6 months
* 9 months later, **Alex invites Jamie**
* Now, you only have 3 months left in your Tier 2 reward window for Alex —\
  ✅ So you earn **1% of Jamie’s Sporties** for **3 months only**

📌 If Jamie had joined earlier — say at Month 3 — you would have earned Tier 2 rewards on Jamie for the full 6 months.

***

### 🕓 Referral Link Expiry

Referral links are tracked via **cookies** and are valid for **7 days** from the last click.\
If someone clicks your link again — the 7-day timer resets.

***

### ⛓️ Reward Unlock Timing

To keep things fair and sybil-resistant:

* **Referral Sporties only become claimable 14 days after your referee earns them**
* This allows time to verify that referees didn’t instantly dump or abandon their activity
* Until then, your referral rewards are **pending and visible**, but **not on-chain or spendable**

✅ A network-wide unlock happens every **2 weeks**, making your pending Sporties claimable if eligible.

### 🚀 Future Expansion (Under Consideration)

We're exploring ways to grow the referral system further — without breaking the balance:

* Limited-time **fee-sharing incentives**
* Referral-based **leaderboards & streaks**
* **Airdrop boost bonuses** for top referrers
* Special rewards for onboarding milestone users (e.g. 10th, 50th, 100th referral)

> These are not live, but we’re actively researching designs that reward growth while preserving fairness.

### ⚡ Bottom Line

Bring fans. Grow the ecosystem. Stack more Sporties.\
You already know who’s gonna ape in — you might as well get rewarded for it.
