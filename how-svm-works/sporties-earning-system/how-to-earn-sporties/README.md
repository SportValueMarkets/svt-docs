# How to Earn Sporties

**Earn as you engage. Stake as you support. Build while you cheer.**

Sporties are earned across every layer of SVM — whether you're trading Player Tokens, staking into the protocol, completing social quests, or inviting fellow fans to the revolution.

This page breaks down the **3 core ways** to stack your Sporties — each with its own set of strategies and sub-rewards.

***

### 🔗 1. On-Chain Actions

These are the heartbeat of SVM: using the dApp, buying tokens, staking, and contributing liquidity.\
You earn Sporties every time you interact with Player Tokens on-chain — and some actions come with **boosted or daily rewards**.

Head to On-Chain Actions → for the full breakdown.

### 🌐 2. Social Tasks

Every meme, post, like, follow, and quest helps us grow — and earns you points.\
We use platforms like Zealy and TaskOn to run official campaigns, with all XP earned converting into Sporties by the end of the season.

We’ll even highlight high-priority posts with **bonus point multipliers**.

Head to Social Tasks → to get your first quests.

### 🧲 3. Referrals

Bring in your crew, your sports group chats, or your crypto friends — and get rewarded.

You’ll earn a percentage of every Sportie your invitees earn, all on-chain:

* **10% from direct invites**
* **1% from second-level referrals**

Each referral lasts for 7 days from the last click — so stay active and keep the flow alive.

### 🧠 Pro Tips

* Certain players or events may have **campaign boosts** (e.g. “Earn 2x Sporties for buying this token today”)
* The **earlier you participate**, the more valuable your Sporties may be — especially if supply is low and demand surges
* You can **combine all 3 methods** for max stacking — and see your total rise in real time

### 📊 Transparent & Fair

All your Sporties are earned, tracked, and redeemable transparently.\
There’s no pay-to-play. No shortcuts. Just pure protocol participation.
