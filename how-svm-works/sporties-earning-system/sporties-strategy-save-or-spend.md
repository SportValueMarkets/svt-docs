# Sporties Strategy: Save or Spend?

Sporties aren’t just points — they’re the **currency of conviction** inside the SVM ecosystem.

You only get one chance to allocate per campaign. No redo. No second guessing. Just strategy.

So… how should you play it?

***

### 🧩 Choose Your Style of Play

#### 🎯 1. The Sniper – Go All-In on One Player

You see the breakout star before anyone else. You go deep.

* **Maximize your proportional rewards**
* Big commitment = Big slice of the 80%
* Can dominate under-the-radar campaigns

🧠 Tip: Use this when you have high conviction or early alpha on a rising athlete.

***

#### 🌊 2. The Net – Farm the BAGs

Spread your Sporties across many campaigns and hit the minimum for each.

* **Stack guaranteed rewards** from multiple pools
* Diversified risk: even if one underperforms, others can hit
* Avoids missing out on hidden gems

🧠 Tip: Use this when your goal is consistency over big wins.

***

#### 🔍 3. The Scout – Find the Hidden Gems

Look for campaigns with low total allocations so far.

* **Higher proportional yield** for early allocators
* Easier to dominate early-stage pools
* Often overlooked = more upside

🧠 Tip: Track live campaign stats and look for underdog athletes.

#### 🔄 4. The Roller – Recycle and Reinvest

Let your Sporties accumulate from staking + actions, and deploy in waves.

* Plan your allocations weekly or monthly
* Monitor leaderboard trends and time your entries
* Build reserves for massive upcoming drops

🧠 Tip: Holding for one mega drop can pay off — but it’s risky if you miss.

### ⚠️ Risk Factors to Consider

* **BAG is fixed, not the reward size**: More users = smaller slice, even if you qualify.
* **Proportional share depends on others**: If whales enter late, your share shrinks.
* **Early allocation doesn’t guarantee dominance**: But it does lock your position — and can influence the hype.

***

### 🔐 Strategic Fundamentals

* **Time your entry**: Early allocators attract attention. Ride that wave — or stay low and sneak in value.
* **Track minimums**: Miss the threshold = no BAG. Always check before committing.
* **Use data**: Allocation stats and community sentiment can inform your moves.
