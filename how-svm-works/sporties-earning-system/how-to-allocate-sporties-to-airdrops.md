# How to Allocate Sporties to Airdrops

**Sporties** are your airdrop fuel. They let you **compete for real token rewards** in every SPT launch — and how you allocate them is where the game begins.

You decide which athletes to back, how much to commit, and whether to spread your bets or go all in. Each decision carries risk, strategy, and upside. Welcome to the fan-powered economy.

***

### 🔁 How It Works

* Every new **SPT (Player Token)** launch has its own **airdrop campaign**.
* You **allocate Sporties** to join that campaign and earn a share of the token drop.
* Once you’ve allocated Sporties to a campaign, that amount **is locked and cannot be reduced** — but you **can always add more** before the campaign closes.
* This means early commitment shows conviction, and **every campaign’s hype only goes up**.

> Allocation is a signal: the more Sporties go in, the more it attracts attention.\
> Be early, be bold — and watch the pool grow.

### ⏳ The 3 Phases of an Airdrop

1. #### **Allocation Phase**
   * Campaign is live. Sporties can now be committed.
   * You can allocate more Sporties anytime — but **never remove or reassign** what's already in.
   * Each campaign runs for a set number of days before locking.
2. #### **Calculation Phase**
   * The token officially **launches with a bonding curve**.
   * The allocation window closes.
   * Final snapshots are taken and reward shares are calculated.
3. #### **Distribution Phase**
   * Once the **bonding curve completes** and the token becomes **freely tradable**, claims go live.
   * You can now claim the SPTs you earned based on your Sporties contribution.

### 📊 Airdrop Breakdown: The 80/20 Split

Each airdrop campaign has a set token pool — and here’s how it’s split:

* **🧮 80% Proportional Allocation**\
  – Your Sporties determine your share of this pool.\
  – More Sporties = Bigger slice.
* **✅ 20% Base Airdrop Guarantee (BAG)**\
  – If you committed at least the **minimum required Sporties**, you qualify for an **equal share** of this pool.\
  – The number of **other participants doesn’t affect your eligibility**, but the **more people who qualify**, the **smaller the slice**.\
  – It’s not about how many Sporties others commit — it’s about whether they **cross the threshold** or not.

> 🧠 Minimum threshold = equal access to the BAG\
> But size of the bag = shared across all who qualified

### 🏅 Ambassador Airdrops: Ultra Fan Bonus

Every airdrop also includes an **additional 5% of tokens** set aside for Ultra Fans — our top contributors.

* Uses the **same 80/20 system**
* Based on **Ultra Fan Points** (not Sporties)
* Available only to verified members of the **Ultra Fans Program**

***

### ⚠️ Important Rules

* Allocated Sporties **cannot be removed** once committed — but you can **always add more**.
* **You must meet the minimum threshold** to qualify for the **BAG** portion of the airdrop.
* If you allocate **zero** Sporties to a campaign, you get **zero rewards** — no automatic enrollment.
* You can **save Sporties** to use in future campaigns. They don’t expire.
* **Only the proportional part** is guaranteed for any valid allocation — the BAG requires a minimum commitment.

***

### 🧠 Strategy Tips

* **Stack the BAGs**: If you commit the minimum to many campaigns, you can rack up multiple guaranteed airdrop slices.
* **Go All-In**: If you believe in one athlete’s potential, commit big to maximize your proportional share.
* **Find Hidden Gems**: Early or underrated athletes may attract fewer Sporties — giving you a bigger slice of both the 80% and BAG pools.
* **Watch the Meta**: Every campaign has different levels of hype — track the leaderboard to adjust where you go heavier.
* **Don’t Spread Too Thin**: Spamming tiny allocations might miss the BAG threshold and get you nothing.
