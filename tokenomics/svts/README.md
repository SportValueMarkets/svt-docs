# 🪙 SVTs

SVT (Sport Value Token) is the lifeblood of the SVM protocol — the token that gives you a voice, a share, and a seat at the table.

It’s not just a ticker. SVT is how the protocol becomes truly community-owned and future-proof.

#### 🔓 Not Live Yet — But Everything Leads to It

SVT will launch after the first phase of SPT airdrops and adoption is underway. We're seeding the ecosystem with athletes and fans first — and then decentralizing the ownership.

SVT is **coming soon**, and when it does, it’ll change everything.

### 🧩 What SVT Unlocks

* 🗳 **Governance Power** — Propose and vote on everything: athlete launches, protocol parameters, treasury use.
* 📈 **Revenue Share** — Stake SVT to earn a slice of the protocol’s revenue.
* 🛠 **Ecosystem Coordination** — SVT will govern new features, league onboarding, SPT upgrades, and beyond.
* 🌍 **Protocol Expansion** — The DAO (via SVT) will fund future dApps, integrations, and ecosystem tools built on SVM.

### 🛠 Why It’s Designed This Way

SVM starts with the fans and scales with the athletes — but **ownership** must belong to the community.

By waiting to launch SVT until there’s real usage, traction, and protocol revenue, we avoid hype-driven emissions and build something durable.

The goal?

> A real economy, governed by those who use and grow it.

### 🧠 TL;DR

* SVT is the native governance and coordination token for SVM
* It launches after key protocol adoption milestones
* It will enable DAO governance, revenue share, and ecosystem growth
* It’s the bridge from memecoins to meaningful ownership
