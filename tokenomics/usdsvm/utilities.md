# 🛠️ Utilities

SVT (Sports Value Token) is more than just a governance token — it’s a multi-utility asset that powers user incentives, protocol alignment, and ecosystem expansion across SVM. Its utility grows over time as more modules and dApps are built into the protocol.

***

### 🗳 Governance (veSVT)

Stake SVT to receive **veSVT** (vote-escrowed SVT), which gives you:

* **Voting rights** in the DAO
* **Proposal creation** for protocol changes
* **Control over treasury spend, SPT launches, rewards adjustments**, and more
* **Greater weight for longer locks** — the longer you lock, the more veSVT you receive

***

### 💸 Protocol Revenue Sharing

Staking SVT also grants access to **ongoing revenue streams**, including:

* Fees from SPT trades
* Vault activity and staking flows
* dApp-generated revenue on top of the protocol

Long-term SVT stakers become **economic co-owners** of the entire SVM ecosystem.

### 💥 Boosts & Access

Holding or staking SVT will unlock access to exclusive perks across the protocol:

* **Discounts on certain protocol fees**
* **Enhanced airdrop allocations**
* **Better access to new SPT launches**
* **Priority whitelisting for future sales**
* Potential **tier-based roles and DAO powers**

***

### 🧩 Ecosystem Integration

As the ecosystem expands, SVT will look to unlock new use cases in third-party and community-built applications, these may include:

* **Fantasy leagues and prediction markets**
* **Scouting and analytics tools**
* **Fan-governed teams and tournaments**
* Custom smart contracts that **gate features via SVT stake or hold**

***

### 🔮 Future Utility Modules

SVM’s roadmap could includes additional utility for SVT in future phases such as:

* **Fee-free trading tiers** for high-volume users
* **veSVT-based reward weighting**
* **SVT-locked vault boosts** (e.g. higher staking yield)
* **Liquidity mining programs** for key SPT/SVT pools

***

### 🧠 TL;DR

SVT is the protocol’s engine — staked for power, held for access, and used for influence.\
As the SVM ecosystem matures, its utility compounds — turning every SVT holder into a long-term builder.
