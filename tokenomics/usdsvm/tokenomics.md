### 🔒 Vesting Philosophy

SVM is committed to long-term sustainability. That’s why:

* **Team & Advisor tokens** have long lock-ups and gradual releases to ensure accountability.
* **Private and seed investors** are vested with cliffs to align early supporters with the project’s growth.
* **Public and KOL allocations** are structured to boost initial liquidity and momentum, while maintaining fairness.

### 🌱 Early Supply Strategy

At Token Generation Event (TGE), circulating supply is limited to:

* Public Sale allocation (7.5%)
* Initial Airdrop (with vesting)
* Liquidity pool allocation
* A small portion of initial rewards and treasury as needed

This ensures early scarcity while gradually ramping up supply as adoption grows.

### 🏛️ Treasury & DAO

The Treasury (12.5%) is governed by SVT stakers via the SVM DAO. It funds protocol development, grants, strategic partnerships, and long-term liquidity — all aligned through decentralized governance.
