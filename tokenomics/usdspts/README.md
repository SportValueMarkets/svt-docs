# ⚽ $SPTs

$**SPTs (Sports Performance Tokens)** are the core primitive of the SVM protocol — a revolutionary new on-chain asset class that transforms athletes into tradable markets and fans into true stakeholders.

Every professional athlete gets their own token. Fans can buy, stake, earn, and compete — all while backing the players they love, or the hidden gems they believe in.

**This isn’t fantasy sports. This is ownership.**

#### 🔥 A New On-Chain Asset Class

SPTs are a new financial primitive that combines the best of:

* **Meme coins** (viral energy, tradeable, community-driven)
* **DeFi** (staking, rewards, liquidity)
* **Fantasy sports** (performance-based upside)
* **Social investing** (fans = value creators)

They're not just tokens — they’re identity, conviction, and clout wrapped into one. SPTs are the **beating heart of the SportFi movement**.

#### 🧠 How They Work

* Each athlete has a **fixed-supply ERC-20 token** with a total of **1 billion tokens**
* Launched via a **bonding curve**, $SPTs start at a base price and rise as demand increases
* Once the bonding curve ends, the token becomes freely tradeable across DEXs
* Early buyers benefit from lower entry and **bonus staking multipliers**

***

#### 💪 Stake to Earn

$SPTs can be **staked for weekly rewards**, with yields based on real-world performance. This is **no-loss staking** — your tokens are never lost, just earn more or less depending on how your athlete performs.

***

#### 🎯 Fan Power in Action

Holding and staking $SPTs:

* Earns **Sporties** (your reward points for the entire protocol)
* Qualifies you for **airdrop allocations**
* Boosts your **status** as a fan
* Builds your **reputation** and long-term upside as the ecosystem grows

***

#### 🌐 More Than Just Tokens

$SPTs aren’t a one-time gimmick — they’re the foundation of a new on-chain sports economy.

* Future dApps will plug into $SPTs: games, fantasy leagues, prediction markets, scouting apps
* Developers, DAOs, and teams can build on top of them
* A growing ecosystem of fan-owned sport finance — **and you're early**

**This is just the beginning.**\
