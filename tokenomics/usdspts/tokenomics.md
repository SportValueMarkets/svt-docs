# 💸 Tokenomics

Each $**SPT (Sports Performance Token)** represents a real athlete and is launched with a **fixed 100 million token supply**, transparently allocated across 8 categories to support long-term growth, community incentives, and protocol sustainability.

These tokens are **ERC-20 standard**, tradable, stakeable, and driven by a performance-linked economy where fans benefit from being early, loyal, and engaged.

#### 🔒 Vesting Schedule

The $SPT model avoids early concentration or dump risk:

* Public tokens are liquid from day one (except bonding curve lock-ups).
* All other categories follow clear **linear monthly vesting** after a defined **lock period**.
* This ensures fair token flow, gradual decentralization, and stable market growth over time.

***

#### 💰 Design Principles

* **No Inflation, No Dilution**: Every $SPT is capped at **100 million tokens**, with no future minting. What changes isn’t supply — it’s the demand, performance, and utility.
* **Long-Term Alignment**: Founders, players, and treasury allocations unlock slowly, linking their incentives to protocol success.
* **Community-Driven Value**: Most of the supply (65%+) is in the hands of the community via public, airdrop, rewards, and liquidity allocations.
