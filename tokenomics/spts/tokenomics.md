# Tokenomics

Each **SPT (Sports Performance Token)** represents a unique athlete and is launched with a transparent, fixed-supply distribution model designed for long-term growth, performance-based engagement, and fan alignment.

Every SPT is a **standard ERC-20 token** with a **hard cap of 1 billion tokens**, distributed across eight categories:

| Category     | Allocation | Vesting (Months) | Lockup (Months) |
| ------------ | ---------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| 🧑‍💻 Team   | 9%         | 18               | 6               |

#### 🌀 Distribution Dynamics

* **Public Sale**: 15% released at launch. This includes bonding curve participants and early buyers — the true believers who help establish the athlete's market value from day one.
* **Airdrops**: 10.5% distributed through a unified, gamified airdrop system — rewarding fans based on activity, performance conviction, and community growth. Ultra Fans receive an additional 5% of that value, allocated separately.
* **Rewards Vault**: The 40% allocated to staking rewards is streamed over 3 years and fuels weekly **performance-based earnings** for those who stake SPTs.
* **Player Share**: Athletes receive 10% of their own SPTs, aligned with community success and protocol growth. This share is vested and locked to ensure long-term alignment.
* **Team & Advisors**: Structured to unlock gradually to align with the long-term development of each athlete market.

#### 🔒 Vesting Schedule

The vesting system ensures that no one — not players, not the team, not early buyers — can dominate or dump the market early.

* **Public tokens** are fully liquid from the start (except those bought through bonding curve lock).
* **All other categories** follow **linear monthly vesting** after their respective lockups end.

This ensures **predictable token flows**, gradual decentralization, and protection against volatility.

#### 🔁 Inflation-Free Model

Each SPT has a **fixed cap of 1B tokens**.\
No minting. No supply creep. No dilution.\
The token is born fully designed — what changes is the **value and demand** created by the community, performance, and protocol growth.
