# Sporties

Sporties are SVM’s in-protocol loyalty points — earned through usage, activity, and support for athletes.\
They fuel your airdrop allocations, track your engagement, and unlock your status in the community.\
They’re non-transferable and non-sellable — and that’s by design.

But just because they’re not a token doesn’t mean they’re not powerful.

#### 🔁 How Sporties Are Issued

**Sporties are earned through key on-chain actions**, calculated daily and claimable after a week.\
You don’t get them instantly — but once earned, they’re yours forever (even if unclaimed).

Here’s how they’re issued:

**✅ On-Chain Actions That Earn Sporties:**

* **Buying SPTs**\
  → Get points for every purchase (amount-based)
* **Selling SPTs**\
  → Lose points — and if selling during bonding curves, the penalty is double
* **Staking SPTs**\
  → Earn daily points based on the amount and duration staked\
  → Must be staked for a full day to count
* **Providing Liquidity (post-launch)**\
  → Earn points for adding LP once an SPT is live and trading

> ⏳ Sporties are calculated every 24 hours and claimable after a 7-day delay.\
> Claiming is manual — unclaimed points are still yours, but future actions will cost more gas to claim them simultaneously.

#### 🛡 Why They're Non-Transferable

Sporties are a **reputation and activity layer**, not a tradable asset.\
We designed them to reflect real engagement — not to be botted, sold, or gamed.

They live **on-chain** in a custom contract — and are bound to your wallet identity.\
This makes them ideal for things like:

* Rewarding loyalty, not speculation, or direct P2W
* Powering fair airdrops and campaigns
* Enabling tiered access, quests, and roles
* Building transparent, trackable user scores

#### 🧠 Future Redemption Ideas (Under Consideration)

Sporties aren’t just for airdrops.\
We’re exploring other uses — potentially including:

* **Exclusive access** to limited campaigns
* **Discounted fees** or special staking boosts
* **DAO voting boosts** for active users
* **Point shop** redemptions (merch, collectibles, access)
* **Achievement systems** — on-chain roles, badges, or NFTs
* **Social layers** — leaderboard, reputation score, etc.

#### 🚫 Why No Reset?

We’re not planning any seasonal resets or wipeouts.\
But to encourage ongoing engagement, we may explore:

* **Soft decay mechanisms**
* **Activity-based multipliers**
* **Quests and missions** to keep your score growing

You earned your Sporties — they’re meant to last.\
But the most active users will always have new ways to grow and win.
