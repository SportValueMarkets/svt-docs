# 🏅 Sporties

Sporties are SVM’s in-protocol loyalty points — earned through usage, activity, and support for athletes.\
They fuel your airdrop allocations, track your engagement, and unlock your status in the community.

They’re non-transferable and non-sellable — and that’s by design.\
But just because they’re not a token doesn’t mean they’re not powerful.

#### 🔁 How Sporties Are Issued

Sporties are earned through key on-chain actions, calculated daily and claimable after a 7-day delay.

You don’t get them instantly — but once earned, they’re yours forever (even if unclaimed).\
Claiming is manual, and unclaimed points are preserved — though future actions may cost more gas to claim them simultaneously.

**✅ On-Chain Actions That Earn Sporties:**

* **Buying SPTs**\
  → Get points based on amount purchased
* **Selling SPTs**\
  → Lose points — with a **2x penalty** if selling during the bonding curve launch
* **Staking SPTs**\
  → Earn daily points based on the amount and duration\
  → Only full-day stakes are counted (no partial-day credit)
* **Providing Liquidity** _(post-launch only)_\
  → Earn points when you add LP to a live, tradable SPT

⏳ **Sporties are calculated every 24 hours** and become **claimable after 7 full days**.

#### 🛡 Why They’re Non-Transferable

Sporties aren’t meant to be traded — they’re designed to measure real engagement.

They live in a custom on-chain contract and are **bound to your wallet**, acting as your reputation layer across the protocol.

This keeps the system:

* Fair and bot-resistant
* Aligned with real user activity
* Transparent and verifiable

Sporties power systems such as:

* Loyalty rewards
* Airdrop allocations
* Status and access roles
* Long-term reputation building

#### 🧠 Future Redemption Ideas _(Under Consideration)_

Sporties aren’t just for airdrops — they may become central to other utilities as the ecosystem evolves.

Potential uses include:

* Special campaign access and pre-launch whitelists
* Fee discounts or staking boosts
* Temporary governance boosts for active users
* Point-shop redemptions (merch, collectibles, in-game perks)
* Achievement badges, on-chain roles, or NFTs
* Leaderboards and community reputation layers

#### 🚫 Why No Reset?

We’re not planning seasonal resets or wipes.\
Your Sporties are yours — permanently.

But to keep engagement high, we may experiment with:

* Soft decay over long inactivity periods
* Activity-based multipliers or streak bonuses
* Quests and missions to continually grow your score

You earned your Sporties — and the ecosystem is designed to keep rewarding that.
