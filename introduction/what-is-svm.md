# ⚙️ What is SVM

> **SVM (Sport Value Market)** is a decentralized Web3 protocol that transforms real-life athletes into tradable, stakeable, performance-driven tokens — and turns fans into stakeholders.

It’s part fantasy sports, part DeFi, part meme economy — and entirely new.

This isn’t a sportsbook. It’s not traditional fantasy. It’s the **infrastructure layer for fan-owned markets**, where every athlete gets a token, every moment has upside, and every fan can finally monetize their knowledge and loyalty.

***

### 🧩 A New Kind of Market

At its core, SVM is:

*   #### 🏅 A Token Factory for Athletes

    Every athlete gets a fixed-supply ERC-20 token, scored by live performance and driven by community demand.

    #### 🔁 A No-Loss Staking System

    Stake player tokens to earn weekly rewards — no betting, no downside. Your tokens stay in your wallet, win or lose.

    #### 🪂 An Infinite Airdrop Engine

    Every player token launch comes with its own airdrop campaign. More tokens = more drops = more chances to earn.

    #### 💰 A Revenue-Generating Flywheel

    Trades, staking, and protocol fees feed into buybacks, LPs, burns, and DAO-controlled rewards.

    #### 🧠 A Community-Governed DAO

    SVT holders decide what gets built, who gets funded, and how the protocol evolves.

### 🪙 The Three Pillars of the SVM Economy

#### 1. **SPTs (Sport Player Tokens)**

ERC-20 tokens for each athlete.

* Fixed supply, live scoring, real utility
* Stake for rewards based on performance
* Trade based on virality, fandom, or breakout moments

#### 2. **SVT (Sport Value Token)**

The governance + coordination token of the protocol.

* Vote on proposals
* Share protocol revenue
* Guide launches, partnerships, and upgrades

#### 3. **Sporties**

Our unified cross-platform XP system.

* Earned through staking, quests, trading, referrals
* Used to enter airdrop pools across the ecosystem
* On-chain, transparent, and flexible

### 🌐 Protocol + Product + Playground

SVM is more than an app. It’s an open engine for:

* Sportfi games & fantasy leagues
* Meme-based prediction markets
* Creator-led athlete campaigns
* Real-time trading and staking layers

Builders get open access. Fans get early entry.\
Memes become markets. Sports become stakeable.

### 🚀 Why It’s Built This Way

Because the old sports economy was rigged against fans.

* You cheer, they profit.
* You follow, they monetize.
* You see the next star... and get nothing.

SVM flips that:

* You find a player early = rewards
* You create hype = ecosystem growth
* You stake and hold = shared upside

This is sportfi. This is ownership.\
**This is how fans win.**
