# Governance token

SVC token holders have voting rights (see DAO governance). SVC tokens need to be staked in order to vote (staked SVC tokens are called veSVC). Staked SVC tokens also receive a percentage of the protocol revenue (see Protocol > Economics section)

SVC token is also an utility token:

* Staked SVC tokens will provide discount in fees (-30%)
* SVC tokens are earned not only by staking but from referrals, bug bounties, voting and other community incentives
* SVC token is also offered to users depositing into vaults (liquidity mining program)
