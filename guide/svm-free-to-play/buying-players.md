# Buying Players

Once you have selected a player you want to buy, you can press the buy button (ethere from the sport market view or from the player details screen). That opens the trade dialog:

In the trade dialog you can see current price for one token, and you current balance, if any.  There are two buttons: buy and sell. To buy player tokens, you select BUY. Then you need to input the amount of virtual cash you want to spend. That gives you an estimation of how many tokens you will get. It is impossible to know exactly how many tokens can be purchased because the pruce can change while the order is processed (this is called slippage). We will add slippage protection in the future. The estimated amount to purchase includes a slippage estimation.

Once you happy with the estiation you can hit BUY. This will set the order to buy tokens to the server.
