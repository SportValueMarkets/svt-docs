# Payouts

When you own player tokens, you are entitled to performance relate payouts. Whenever there is a reallife sports competition, like a football match, athletes are rated based on their performance. For example, for football players, we can see every match they payed in the profile and the score they have received from playing and being part of their team:

The scoring is based on a formula ([The Scoring Matrix](../../basics/scoring-matrix.md)). Every week, the best performing player tokens receive payouts based on their score for the week. You can track your payouts in Profile > Transactons:
