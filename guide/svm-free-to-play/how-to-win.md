# How to Win

The goal is to accumulate the most SVP tokens. To do so you can trade tokens: buy low, sell high, or buy an dhold and collect SVP payouts based on player performance. There will be a leader board wth the user who have earned the most SVP and will receive prizes (cash, tokens, etc).

Also, every month, users will be able to convert a portion of their earned SVP into SVC (sport value coin, when t gets released) or for real player tokens that are traded with real cash.
