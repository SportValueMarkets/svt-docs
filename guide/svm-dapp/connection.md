# Connection

SVM DApp is decentralised web 3 app. It means that to connect a third party web 3 wallet is needed, suck as Metamask, Coinbase wallet, Phantom, etc. But for those who don't want to manipulate web 3 wallets, we have provided a hosted wallet option, using [ThirdWeb](https://thirdweb.com/).

Press Connect top right to open the connection dialog.
