# Finding Players

From the main screen, also called Market View, you can find all available athletes in the selected sport. For each athlete, we have his name, team, position, last price, and last week score.

Football players can be filtered by country, league and team. They can be sorted by name, price, and last week score. There is also a inpur filed to search in full text, by name, team, etc.
