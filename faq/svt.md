# ðŸª™ SVT

<details>

<summary>What is SVT?</summary>

**SVT** is the governance and value token of the SVM protocol. It powers voting, rewards, protocol growth, and aligns long-term incentives across the entire ecosystem.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is SVT live?</summary>

Not yet. SVT will launch later â€” once the ecosystem has matured through Player Token (SPT) launches and airdrop cycles. Itâ€™s the capstone layer that enables DAO governance and long-term expansion.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What will SVT be used for?</summary>

* **Governance** (voting on protocol upgrades, athlete launches, treasury use)
* **Revenue Sharing** via staking (veSVT model)
* **Protocol utility**: discounts, access, boosting airdrops
* **Ecosystem expansion**: launching new features, tools, or dApps

</details>

<details>

<summary>How does staking SVT work?</summary>

SVT uses a **vote-escrow model (veSVT)**:

* Lock SVT for a period to receive veSVT
* Longer locks = more voting power + higher revenue share
* veSVT is non-transferable and decays linearly over time

</details>

<details>

<summary>Will I need SVT to launch a new SPT?</summary>

Eventually, yes. SVT holders will propose and vote on new athlete token launches. Holding SVT will also grant **priority access** and potential airdrop boosts in those campaigns.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Will SVT have a capped supply?</summary>

Yes. SVT will have a **fixed total supply**, with a transparent tokenomics model released at launch. The majority of the supply will be allocated to the community over time via staking, airdrops, governance rewards, and incentive programs.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Will SVT be sold in a public sale?</summary>

**Yes.** SVT will have a **public sale**, giving early supporters and the wider community the opportunity to acquire governance power. There may also be **private rounds** and **DAO-led allocations** for partners and contributors.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I earn SVT now?</summary>

No â€” not directly. But by participating in the protocol (staking, referrals, Ultra Fan involvement), youâ€™re positioning yourself for **future allocations** and roles that may earn SVT once live.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Will there be incentives to hold SVT long-term?</summary>

Yes. Staking SVT:

* Grants protocol rewards from fees
* Gives governance rights over all protocol levers
* May unlock features, tiers, or exclusive campaign access

The goal is to make SVT the key to long-term power and influence in the SVM ecosystem.
