<summary>What is SVM?</summary>

SVM (Sport Value Market) is a decentralized protocol that transforms real-world athletes into on-chain, performance-based tokens. Fans can buy, stake, and earn from these tokens — turning sports knowledge into upside and fandom into ownership.

<summary>How is SVM different from fantasy sports or sports betting?</summary>

Fantasy = imaginary teams.\
Betting = zero-sum risk.\
**SVM = a tokenized, no-loss staking model.**\
You’re earning from athlete performance and growing the value of real, tradable tokens. No losing tickets, no bookies.

You never lose staked tokens — that’s the core of our **no-loss staking**. Token prices can fluctuate based on market activity, but staking is risk-free in terms of principal.

* You can **unstake** SPTs anytime — rewards are based on full weeks staked.
* You can **sell SPTs** anytime, but selling early (especially during bonding) may reduce your Sporties or earnings.
