# Sporties

<details>

<summary>What are Sporties?</summary>

**Sporties** are non-transferable on-chain points earned through your activity in the SVM ecosystem. They act as your loyalty and participation score — and are the **main currency for accessing airdrops** and ecosystem perks.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I earn Sporties?</summary>

You earn Sporties by accomplishing benefitial actions for the protocol such as:

* **Buying or staking SPTs**
* **Holding staked SPTs daily** (Sporties are issued once per full day of staking)
* **Completing social quests** (TaskOn, Zealy)
* **Referring others** to join and participate

Special campaigns may offer **bonus Sporties** for limited-time actions or specific athlete promotions.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Do I get Sporties from simply holding SPTs?</summary>

No — only **staked** SPTs earn daily Sporties. Holding without staking does not count.\
Also note: **Staking rewards begin only after a full 24-hour cycle.**

</details>

<details>

<summary>When do I receive my Sporties?</summary>

Sporties are:

* **Calculated daily**
* **Claimable after a 7-day delay**
* **Manually claimable** via the SVM dApp

This ensures the ecosystem remains sybil-resistant and rewards users who stay active and staked.

<details>

<summary>What happens if I sell my SPTs?</summary>

* Selling **before claiming** Sporties doesn't erase your earned points — they’re still yours.
* However, your **next Sporties-related transaction** will require a higher gas fee (measured in Sporties) to “unlock” those unclaimed rewards.
* **Selling during the bonding curve phase** results in **double the normal Sporties burn**, as a strong disincentive to early exits.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Do my Sporties ever expire?</summary>

Currently, **Sporties do not expire** and can be used at any time.\
That said, we may explore systems in the future to encourage active participation — such as decay, priority boosts, or redemption incentives — as the ecosystem evolves.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What can I do with Sporties?</summary>

Sporties are used to:

* **Allocate into upcoming SPT airdrops**
* **Boost your share of token distributions**
* **Compete on community leaderboards**
* **In the future may be used to unlock ecosystem perks and possible future features**

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I transfer Sporties?</summary>

No. Sporties are **non-transferable** and **wallet-bound**. They’re designed to reward real user activity, not be gamed or sold.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I boost my Sporties gains?</summary>

Yes. High-performing actions (like referrals or staking popular SPTs) may yield more. The SVM team may also run **time-limited campaigns** where certain players or actions reward extra Sporties — so stay plugged in.
