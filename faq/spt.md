# SPT

<details>

<summary>What are SPTs?</summary>

**SPTs (Sport Player Tokens)** are fixed-supply ERC-20 tokens tied to the real-world performance of individual athletes. They are the foundational asset of the SVM ecosystem — a new type of memecoin that rewards fandom, knowledge, and participation.

<summary>How are SPTs different from regular memecoins?</summary>



While memecoins are usually based on hype alone, **SPTs combine virality with utility**:

* Fixed supply and tradable
* Performance-based staking rewards
* Integrated into airdrop and point systems
* Unique to each athlete, with value tied to both on-field and social activity

<details>

<summary>How is the price of an SPT determined?</summary>

At launch, SPTs use a **bonding curve mechanism**. Early buyers get the lowest price, and the price increases with each new purchase. After the bonding curve finishes, the token becomes freely tradable on the open market.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I sell SPTs?</summary>

Yes — once an SPT exits its bonding curve phase, it becomes **fully liquid** and tradable on DEXs. Selling before the bonding curve ends is discouraged (and penalized via Sporties deductions).

<summary>What can I do with SPTs?</summary>

* **Trade** based on hype, sentiment, or predictions
* **Stake** them to earn weekly rewards tied to performance and protocol activity
* **Earn Sporties** just by holding (staking) them
* **Access airdrops** and boost your ecosystem scor

<details>

<summary>How are new SPTs launched?</summary>

New SPTs are launched through **bonding curve campaigns** with accompanying airdrops. Users can allocate Sporties, help promote, and buy early for the best price. Later on, the community will be able to vote, via SVTs, new SPTs' launches.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How many SPTs can be launched?</summary>

There is **no hard cap**. The goal is to tokenize **every athlete in the world**. New SPTs launch regularly — from global stars to emerging talents.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Do SPTs expire?</summary>

Not by default. However, low-activity or deprecated SPTs may have their reward and staking mechanisms paused over time — based on DAO decisions.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Will there be private sales or allocations?</summary>

Yes. Select SPTs may have **private sales or strategic allocations** before public bonding curve launch — typically for partnerships, influencers, or collaborators.
