# Overview of Free-To-Play

Not everyone’s ready to dive into crypto. That’s fine — we built a way in.\
SVM’s Free-to-Play (F2P) dApp mirrors the real protocol without the wallet, tokens, or on-chain complexity.

It’s the same gameplay loop: scout, allocate, rank, and earn. But instead of $SPTs and gas fees, you’re working with **SVP** — Sport Value Points — to test your edge risk-free.

> It’s how fans prove they’ve got the alpha — before they ever spend a dime.

#### 🎮 Same Rules. No Wallet.

Free-to-Play is a standalone web app built for everyone:

* No crypto onboarding
* No wallet connection
* No KYC
* No fees

You start with **1,000 SVP**. You use them to build a portfolio of athletes for the current gameweek. Your players are scored using the exact same matrix as the main SVM protocol. At the end of the week, your total score determines your leaderboard position.

***

#### 🧠 Why It Works

This isn’t just a tutorial mode. It’s a live environment — with real competition and real incentives.

* Every week is a new challenge
* Everyone starts on equal footing
* There’s no meta — just skill, timing, and foresight
* Leaderboard rankings determine **Sporties payouts** _(coming soon)_

You don’t need a wallet to win. You just need better picks.

#### 🔁 The Gameplay Loop

1. **Get 1,000 SVP** when you sign up
2. **Build your squad** from available athletes
3. **Lock in** before the gameweek kicks off
4. **Score points** based on performance
5. **Climb the leaderboard** and earn rewards _(coming soon)_
6. **Adjust your portfolio** based on your own trades — there’s no reset

You don’t carry over players automatically — but you also don’t lose them unless you sell. Your SVP and Free SPTs remain until you trade.

#### 🚀 Your Bridge Into Crypto

Here’s the alpha: Sporties earned in F2P can be used in the **main protocol**.

* Redeem them for airdrop allocations
* Level up your status
* Gain early access to launches
* Eventually stake or claim $SPTs — without spending ETH

> If you’re sharp, Free-to-Play is how you get in for free.

***

#### 🎁 What You Win

Top performers on the Free-to-Play leaderboards receive:

* **SVP bonuses** to boost their portfolio firepower
* **Sporties**, which translate into real airdrop and staking rewards on-chain

Your strategy and selections determine your place — not your wallet size.\
The higher you rank, the more value you unlock.

> This isn’t a tutorial. It’s a launchpad.

***

#### 🏁 TL;DR

* 1,000 SVP. Weekly scoring. Real-time competition.
* No wallet. No gas. No entry barriers.
* Compete on pure strategy — not who buys first
* Earn Sporties → enter the real game
* Prove your edge. Then bridge into the big leagues.

**Free-to-Play isn’t a demo. It’s the proving ground.**
