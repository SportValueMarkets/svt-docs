# SVP Usage

SVP (Sport Value Points) is your capital inside the Free-to-Play ecosystem. It’s not a token, and it’s not on-chain — but it acts like real money: you buy, you sell, you risk, and you earn.

You get **1,000 SVP once** when you create your account. From there, it’s on you to manage, grow, and allocate it.

> If you use it well, SVP becomes the path to airdrops and crypto access — without ever spending real funds.

#### 🎯 What You Use SVP For

SVP is used to **buy and sell Free SPTs** — simulation versions of athlete tokens used within the F2P dApp.

* Buy Free SPTs before the gameweek
* Sell them after matches to free up SVP
* Price movements reflect performance + popularity
* Your SVP balance changes depending on trading results

If you buy low and sell high — you grow your bankroll.\
If you miss a call and sell at a loss — your SVP drops.

Every choice has a cost. Every trade is a test.

***

#### 🔁 Leaderboards Reset. You Don’t.

While the leaderboard resets each week based on gameweek scores, your **SVP balance and Free SPTs persist** across weeks.

That means:

* You control your portfolio — nothing is force-reset
* You can reallocate by trading at any time
* Long-term strategy matters as much as short-term moves

Performance scoring is week-by-week — but your resources are continuous.

***

#### 🧠 Strategic Depth

Here’s how SVP becomes a tool for proving your edge:

* **Speculate early** on undervalued players
* **Sell before dips** based on matchups or team news
* **Hold strong** if your player’s form is peaking
* Balance risk and reward to protect your capital across weeks

> Every SVP is a move on the board. Every trade writes your story.

***

#### 🏁 TL;DR

* SVP is used to buy and sell Free SPTs
* You start with 1,000 — and can grow or lose it over time
* No resets, no top-ups — your bankroll is what you make of it
* Strategic trading drives your leaderboard rank
* The goal: more Sporties, better access, zero upfront cost

**SVP is capital without crypto — and proof that your strategy works.**
