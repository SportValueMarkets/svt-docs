# From F2P to Crypto

You started with zero risk. Now you’ve got Sporties. The bridge from Free-to-Play to the full SVM protocol is already built — and if you’ve got the insight, you can cross it for free.

> No wallet. No tokens. Just performance. That’s the way in.

#### 🪂 Earn Your Way In

Free-to-Play rewards your leaderboard performance with **Sporties** — the same non-transferable points used across the main SVM ecosystem.

Here’s what Sporties unlock:

* Entry into token airdrops
* Priority for future SPT launches
* Early access to protocol features
* Long-term, on-chain status

You can go from spectator to stakeholder without ever buying a token — just by proving you’ve got better picks.

#### 🧠 Why This Matters

Most crypto protocols are gated by capital, early access, or connections.\
SVM is gated by performance.

* **You don’t need ETH**
* **You don’t need to spend**
* **You just need to outperform**

The better you do in F2P, the faster you build up Sporties — and the deeper you get into SVM.

#### 🏁 From Scoreboard to Blockchain

Once you’ve earned enough Sporties, you’ll be able to:

* Allocate them toward SPT airdrops
* Participate in social and on-chain campaigns
* Start interacting with real tokens — staked, traded, or boosted
* Claim protocol-native rewards based on your effort, not your spend

And when you’re ready, connect a wallet — and start playing with real stakes.

> You’ve already proven your insight. Now it’s time to make it on-chain.

***

#### TL;DR

* Earn Sporties in Free-to-Play through leaderboard rank
* Use those Sporties in the real protocol — for airdrops and more
* No need to buy in — performance is your ticket
* Connect a wallet when you’re ready to bridge
* Your skill = your access

**From F2P to crypto — it’s not a leap. It’s a level-up.**
