# Overview

## What is Sport Valued Tokens?

Sport Value Markets (SVM) is a Web 3 protocol issuing tokens linked to real life performance of athletes. A protocol in the web 3 context is a set of smart contracts executed on a blockchain in a decentralised way. The SVM protocol regulates the issuance of tokens representing athletes (player tokens). It also orchestrates performance related payouts. Each player is scored like in Fantasy Sports games, using statistics from real sports events . SVM protocol is governed by a community driven DAO, using governance tokens (called Sport Value Coins or SVC). SVC token holders have voting powers. SVM is a revenue generating protocol. The revenue from protocol fees is distributed to SVC token holders.

SVM is also an ecosystem composed of:&#x20;

* the tokens representing sports players
* the SVM protocol
* the community and a DAO
* SVM DApp (The Frontend)
* a free to play game powered by the protocol
* third party apps and protocols

## Our Core Principles&#x20;

**Transparency**: leveraging blockchain, transactions and rewards mechanisms are public and verifiable&#x20;

**Sustainability**: transparent tokenomics, no free money, no ponzi mechanisms, clear reward rules, executed by smart contracts on chain, no pump and dump or "rug" pulls are possible. This can be verified by third parties directly on the blockchain.&#x20;

**Community driven**: owned by the community organised in a DAO. Key decisions are voted by governance token holders. No single owner or operator.&#x20;

**Global Reach**: no geographical restrictions, open to everyone Innovation: we don't stop with the launch, it is just the beginning of an iterative and evolutionary process.

## How to Win&#x20;

SVTs can be traded any time on our exchange or on any other exchange. Players are scored when the play matches. The score is then converted to payouts to token holders. You earn when players perform relative to other players. You can earn by buying and holding quality players, or you can decide to trade and profit from price appreciation of the tokens. You earn when players in your portfolio perform well. You can earn by buying and holding tokens of athletes that perform. Or you can decide to trade and profit from the price appreciation of the tokens.&#x20;
